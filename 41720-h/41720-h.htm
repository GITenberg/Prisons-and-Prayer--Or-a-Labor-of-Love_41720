<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Reader</span>: Over twenty years have passed since
God called and commissioned me to go to those that were
bound. Within five years from the time I entered upon
the work, I had been enabled to preach the gospel in every
state and territory and had held meetings in nearly every
state-prison in the United States and in the prisons in Canada
and Mexico. My first trip to Europe was made in
1890. I have not only held meetings in prison, but have
endeavored to "preach the gospel to every creature"&mdash;to
those in authority, governors, prison and railroad officials,
and trainmen, as well as to those in churches, missions, prisons,
hospitals, alms-houses, dives, brothels, saloons and the
slums. In all places God has fulfilled His promise to be
with me and has given me evidence that my labor was not
in vain in Him.</p>

<p>When I was made to feel that the Lord required me to
write of the victories He had wrought and of the work
yet waiting to be done I was amazed and am still, though it
is more than ten years since God first told me to write for
Him. Early left an orphan, my childhood was spent in
the country where I had to walk two miles across the fields
and through deep snows in order to get to school, and my
life-work has been crippled by my lack of education. How
then can I write? Yet the command of the Lord has been
upon me and the cry of the needy has rung in my ears.
Words cannot describe the cruel wrongs, the awful injustice,
the scenes of desolation and degradation that have
come to my knowledge. Much has been done, much is
being done; and yet, O how much still needs to be done,
in behalf of those in prison! Wrongs that are indescribable
still cry to God for vengeance in this our own land. Cruelties
that are beyond the power of language to describe
<em>still exist</em>, and the cry of the oppressed comes up to the ear
of Him who has declared "Vengeance is mine, I will repay."</p>

<p>One reason I have for writing, is to show the great need
of Holy Ghost workers&mdash;those whose hearts God has
touched&mdash;to carry the gospel to those whose lives are darkened,
blighted and blasted, and tell them of a mighty deliverance
from the bondage of sin, and of freedom in Christ.</p>

<p>Reader, if you could see the many inside prison walls
going insane, you would not wonder that, by the grace of
God, I am determined to prosecute my work as I have
never done before, to save these poor prisoners from despair,
and to do with my might what my hands find to do.</p>

<p>I have kept no diary or journal and nearly all of ten
years' correspondence was destroyed at one time by fire.
Hence I have written largely from memory, and without
any attempt to give an orderly and connected account of
my work. I have endeavored to put before you, dear
reader, such glimpses of the work and the field as would
fairly illustrate that which has been done and that which
needs to be done.</p>

<p>I ask for my imperfect work your kind consideration, and
trust that you will overlook my many mistakes and pray
God's blessing to rest upon the effort; and if I can only
awaken in your hearts a deeper compassion for lost girls
and fallen men and the heart-broken friends who mourn
the loss of loved ones, I shall not have written in vain.</p>

<p>In the selection, arrangement and preparation of manuscript,
I have been assisted by several friends who have
been much interested in the work, whose labor and patience
can only be rewarded by Him whom we serve. Among
these are Brother and Sister Shaw, of Chicago, who have so
kindly given the introduction to the work, having full
knowledge of its contents and ability to judge of its merits.
I will also mention Brother and Sister Kelley, of Tabor,
Iowa, who have rendered valuable assistance.</p>

<p>With many prayers and tears I send this work forth,
hoping it may find a place on your book-shelf and a corner
in your heart, and that you and I, dear reader, may meet
where there are no prison walls, iron bars, nor breaking
hearts. And may there be gathered there with us at Jesus'
feet many of those whom we are striving to comfort and
save, while together we crown our Savior Lord of all, and
through an endless eternity worship Him who gave His
life a ransom for the lost&mdash;"because He loved them so."</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>This world is, to a large extent, a great prison house.
Nearly all of its inhabitants are prisoners surrounded by
walls of sin and darkness. Many are bound down by the
curse of rum, others by the besetting sins of lust, unholy
temper, envy, revenge, malice, hatred, jealousy, prejudice,
pride, covetousness, or selfishness resulting from a carnal
mind. Out of the vast multitudes that are led captive by
the devil at his will, a few that have violated human law
have been sentenced to various prisons and reformatories.
This book has much to say about the men and women
behind prison walls. It records the sad story of many
prisoners in a way that very few can read without being
moved to tears and that will awaken sympathy in the hardest
hearts. It also tells of the work of God among prisoners
both in this and other countries. It records some of
the brightest of Christian experiences on record, showing
how many prisoners that have been slaves to worse than
human law and have lived in greater darkness than in the
prison dungeon, have been made free by being translated
into the light that outshines the noonday sun, and how
they have been enabled to live noble, Christian lives behind
the bars.</p>

<p>We are well acquainted with the author, having known
her for several years and having had the privilege of entertaining
her in our home more or less during that time.
This acquaintance has enabled us to know something of
the burden that rests upon her soul for prisoners. She has
doubtless spent more time in the work, visited more prisons
and traveled farther than any other living prison worker.
She has visited practically all of the prisons of the United
States and Canada and most of them many times, and twice
she has crossed the sea. Her mission has been a mission
of loving service, with but little financial reward. But the
Master who laid this work upon her heart has given her
rich reward for all her toil and privation and suffering,
for many have been converted through her instrumentality.
Some have gone to their reward. Many others, both in
and out of prison, are living honest, useful lives.</p>

<p>Had this work been written only for the hasty reader
who has but a few hours at the most to give, much that it
contains might better have been omitted; but such as these
can easily select from its pages that which is most to their
liking, while those who are deeply interested in the work
of soul-saving, as well as the prisoner whose spare hours
drag heavily and slowly, will here find food for study and
encouragement that will repay for many days of careful
reading.</p>

<p>In many respects, such a work as is here represented has
never been done by any other person. For these hundreds
of pages give but a few glimpses, as it were, of the work
"Mother Wheaton" has done. We have assisted her in
gleaning from the many hundreds of letters still in her
possession (though much of her correspondence was destroyed
by fire) and in arranging and preparing matter for
publication. We have listened as with eyes filled with tears
she has told us of the needs of the work, and with every
day thus spent we have become more deeply interested in
the work to which her life has been given. In a memorial
service it was said of the late Bishop William Taylor: "He
was not an organizer nor an administrator; not a statesman,
in the ordinary use of those terms. He was rather a great
religious pioneer. He blazed pathways through unknown
moral wilds, and left the work of organization mainly to
those who might follow after." Such, in her field of labor,
has largely been the work of Mother Wheaton.</p>

<p>No place has been far enough away, no stockade hard
enough to reach, no day warm enough or cold enough or
stormy enough, no prison official or stockade captain sufficiently
abusive, to discourage her when she felt that the
Master bade her go forward.</p>

<p>With a burning love for all the sinful and all the needy,
she has gone from north to south and from east to west,
seeking the lost as one seeks for hidden treasure. Through
nights of weariness and days of toil she has sought them
and loved them and wept over them, man or woman or
child, as a mother weeps over and loves her own. She has
borne their burdens and shared their sorrows&mdash;ever bringing
to them the cheering word, the testimony or inspiring
song, the faithful warning, the earnest prayer, the plain
gospel message, the hearty hand-clasp, the loving "God
bless you."</p>

<p>We believe and pray that these pages may be greatly
used of God to reach thousands of hearts and stir up many
to carry forward the work so dear to her, when "Mother
Wheaton" has crossed over to meet those that are waiting
to welcome her on the other side.</p>

<h3>Biography and Call to the Work.</h3>


<p>I was born May 10, 1844, in Wayne County, Ohio. My
parents, John and Mary Van Nest Ryder, were honest,
hard working people, and were earnest Christians. One
year after my birth, my father died, leaving my mother
with five little children&mdash;three boys and two girls. Mother
married again and had two children. The little girl was
buried the day before mother died. My half-brother, J. P.
Thompson, still lives in Ohio. Five years after my father's
death my mother followed him to the better land, and I, with
the rest, was left an orphan. Well do I remember the night
my mother died. She was so troubled about leaving her
children alone in the world, but continued long in earnest
prayer until she had the assurance that God would care
for them, and then she sang the old-time hymn,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"There is a fountain filled with blood,</span>
<span class="i1">Drawn from Immanuel's veins,"</span>
</div>

<p>and went shouting home to glory. What a lasting impression
is made on a child's heart by the life or death of a
godly father or mother!</p>

<p>By mother's death I was almost crazed with grief and
could not be comforted. At her grave I was separated from
my brothers and sister, and went to live with a family to
whom mother had given me before her death. Some time
after this, the family moving away, I went to live with
my grandparents, under whose careful religious training I
remained until married. I received little education, as my
opportunities were very limited.</p>

<p>From my earliest recollection I was deeply convicted of
sin. This conviction followed me until at the age of twelve
years I gave my heart to God and received the witness that
I was His child. I united with the people called Methodists
and tried to walk in the light I had, until God called
me into His vineyard.</p>


<h4>MARRIAGE.</h4>

<p>At the age of eighteen I was married to Mr. J. A. Wheaton.
We lived happily together, but in two years I was called
to give up not only my dear husband, but also our little baby
boy. They were buried in one grave, and I was again
left alone in the world. O my breaking heart! I was in
despair! I did not know then God's wonderful comforting
power as I now do. I was scarcely more than a nominal
Christian, a fashionable proud woman, moving in high
society, left to face the battle of life alone. To try to
drown my sorrow I rushed deeper into society and fashion&mdash;only
to be plunged into deeper despair. What I suffered
during those years is beyond the power of tongue or pen to
describe. My anguish of heart and mind were so great
that at times reason almost tottered on its throne. And had
it not been for the goodness and mercy of God in sending
me timely aid through true Christian friends, I should
never have been able to have triumphed over it all.</p>

<p>Soon after I was converted, I felt the call of God to His
service. I longed to be a missionary. My heart especially
went out to the colored people and the Indians, and to the
poor unfortunate ones of my own sex. Their sufferings
touched my heart, and it was this class with which I did
some of my first prison and missionary work in after years.
But in those days there was very little encouragement to a
woman to do such work. O how those who are called of
God now should appreciate their privileges!</p>

<p>Though hindered and discouraged, this call did not leave
me. I lived in the church for years, always doing my part
in church work. I was proud and vain, but knew no better;
yet I longed to be all the Lord's.</p>


<h4>SANCTIFICATION.</h4>

<p>Several years after my conversion I heard of holiness or
entire consecration to God, and the baptism of the Holy
Spirit for service. After this, for about ten years, I was
under conviction for a clean heart, seeking for a while and
then growing careless, receiving little help from the formal
professors around me. As I counted the cost, at times it
seemed too great. I knew it meant to give up fashionable
society, home, friends, reputation and all: and to take the
way of the lowly Nazarene. I heard at this time of a
holiness meeting about forty miles from home, which I
attended. Here I heard the pure gospel preached, and light
shone upon my soul. I saw that none but the pure in
heart could see God in peace. After wrestling in prayer
until about three o'clock in the morning, I seemed held by an
invisible power, pure and holy, and was so filled with awe
that I feared to speak or move. Soon I heard a wonderful
sound, soft, sweet and soothing, like the rustle of angels'
wings. Its holy influence pervaded my whole being; a
sound not of earth, but distinctly audible to both myself
and the sister who was in the same room! I listened enraptured.
I feared it was death, and my breath grew shorter
and shorter. I did not move nor open my eyes. Presently
Jesus stood before me, and O the wonderful look of
love&mdash;so far above the love of mortals, so humble, meek
and pleading! In the tender voice of the Holy Spirit came
these words: "Can you give up all and follow me? Lay
your weary, aching head upon my breast. I will never leave
you nor forsake you. Lo, I am with you alway even unto
the end of the world." I was enabled by the Holy Spirit
to say, "Yes, Lord Jesus." I knew it was Jesus. When I
said "Yes, Lord," the power of God fell upon me, soul and
body, and I was bathed in a sea of glory. When I had
recovered from my rapture, Jesus had vanished as silently
as He came; but the blessing and power remained. The
sister whispered and asked, "Did you hear that sound?"
And then she told me that this was for my benefit. This
occurred November 11, 1883. That day the people looked
at me and wondered, seeing the great change God had
wrought in me by His power. The night following we had
an all-night meeting. Again God spoke to me by His Holy
Spirit, saying, "Go and honor my Son's name, and I will
go with you." I prayed, "O Lord, if this is Thy voice,
speak once more." The same words came again. I obeyed
and God did most wonderfully reveal Himself to me. I
knew I was called to His service and to work for lost souls.</p>

<h4>MY CALL TO PRISON WORK.</h4>

<p>The question is often asked me, "How did you become
interested in this work, and learn to understand the needs
of the prisoner?" It was through this call from God.
None of my relatives or friends were ever convicted of
crime. When I was a young woman I attended the state
fair at Columbus, Ohio, and with a delegation visited the
state-prison at that place. While waiting for a guide to
show us through the prison a young man was brought in
by an officer. I saw him searched, and later as the heavy
iron doors closed behind him with a clang, my sympathies
were aroused. While being shown through the prison I saw
this young man with his hair close cut, dressed in prisoners'
garb, placed by the side of hardened criminals. There my
first interest was awakened to try to make the burdens
lighter for the prison-bound. As we were leaving the prison
I noticed some small articles which had been made by
the inmates in their spare moments. Among these I saw
and was especially impressed with a miniature statue of a
prisoner dressed in stripes, holding in one hand a ball and
chain, the other hand shading the eyes. Upon the pedestal
of the statue were these words, "What shall the harvest
be?" I shall never forget the impression then made upon
my mind. It is still fresh in my memory.</p>

<p>Years after this, shortly after my commission to preach
the gospel, as I was traveling one night to reach an appointment,
stopping at a station in Iowa to change cars,
three prisoners in handcuffs, who were being taken to the
state-prison, were brought in. My heart was moved with
deep compassion for them. Many were curiously inspecting
them, as if they thought they had no tender feelings.
Approaching these men, I gave them my hand, saying, "I
am sorry for you, but God can help you in this hour of
trial," and I tried to cheer them, and told them I would
sometime visit them in the prison if I could. I did not
then know I was so soon to enter upon my mission. But
the burden of those in prison kept coming heavier upon me.
I told my friends I must go and</p>


<h4>PREACH THE GOSPEL TO PRISONERS</h4>

<p>but they for a time thought me almost crazy. But as
one of old, I felt that "Woe is me if I preach not the
Gospel." So I gladly obeyed the divine call and went forward.</p>

<p>But I was not led into this work by any morbid sentimentalism
or enthusiasm. These would have worn off when
the novelty was gone. No, this work was given me of God,
who Himself laid the burden of the convict world upon my
heart. Day and night there came up before me the cry of
despair from inside prison walls&mdash;the wail of woe from those
in dungeons whose hearts were breaking and whose minds
were shattered and whose souls were lost in despair, and
the call came direct from the mouth of the Lord, "Go and
stand in the breach! Tell them of a Savior's love&mdash;of a
way of escape through the blood of Jesus Christ, who is
mighty to save and strong to deliver them from the snares
of the enemy that has sought to destroy them soul and
body. Tell them there is deliverance for the captive. Tell
them there is consolation in the gospel of Christ for those
who are heart-broken and forsaken and forgotten by all
but an omnipotent God. Tell them that God lives and
rules and reigns in heaven and is able to save to the uttermost
and to comfort in their dying hours with the hope of
eternal life beyond this vale of tears."</p>

<p>But how could I go? The Lord Himself showed me how
to go and where to go and that I was to leave results to
Him and He would give the increase&mdash;that He would multiply
the bread and fish for the hungry multitudes&mdash;He
would feed the famished souls to whom He sent me, just as
when He walked this sin-cursed earth&mdash;that He was the
same yesterday, today and forever. I saw that my life
must be entirely and forever surrendered to the Lord for
His service, and that my future was to be left entirely in
the hands of the Master whose I am and whom I serve.</p>

<p>Thus the call came day after day and night after night
until I believe I should have gone insane had I not then
and there yielded my time and talent, all I had or ever
would have, to the service of Christ to go just when and
where He would have me go, do as He would have me do,
and trust Him for my support. I was shown that I would
never come to want. I was made to understand that these
poor unfortunates in prison were just as dear to God's heart
as I was and that souls would be required at my hands were
I to fail to comply with the commission to go and lift up
the fallen and comfort the dying and relieve those distressed
in body and mind. I was made to know that there was
power in prayer and that God could save the very lowest
criminal or the worst woman on earth and by the transforming
influence of the Holy Spirit and the cleansing
blood of Jesus, save, purify and sanctify and lift them up
even within the pearly gates of heaven; and that instead of
devils in human form, they could be made saints that could
take up the glad refrain unto Him that had redeemed them
and washed them in his own blood and made them kings
and priests unto God.</p>

<p>Yes, God called me. And His name shall be exalted
through all eternity for what He has done for me and
through me during all these years. His has been the hand
that fed, clothed and supported me. Never has God failed
me in this pilgrim journey and He has supplied all my
needs. My heart goes out in gratitude and thanksgiving
while I write, for all He has done for me. O, the heights
and depths, lengths and breadths of His boundless love for
lost humanity! How wonderfully has He led me! How
His guiding hand, His protecting care have been over me!
Amid discouragements, disappointments and misunderstandings
God has given me victory through the blood of
our precious, loving Savior; and I know that He is able to
do exceedingly abundantly above all we can ask or think.</p>

<p>When I saw the criminal at the bar of justice, I was
reminded that we must all soon appear at the judgment bar
of God. Then I saw that the Lord wanted me to tell of a
Mighty Deliverer from the sins of intemperance, unbelief,
skepticism, infidelity, covetousness, licentiousness and hypocrisy.
My eyes were opened to see that thousands of poor
helpless souls were drifting to their eternal doom without
God and without hope, and that ofttimes in their hours of
most desperate need there was no one to help, no one to
point them to the blessed Savior and to really snatch them
as "brands from the burning."</p>

<p>Then I took courage and said, "Yes, Lord, I will go and
do my best to help save them from destruction and an eternity
in hell." Since then I have spent more than twenty
years of constant toil among the masses and have reason to
declare that God has given me success beyond what I could
have thought possible.</p>

<p>Multitudes have been saved, representing all ranks and
stations of life. Many are today singing the songs of the
redeemed with the glorified hosts in the other world, who
were counted by many to be beyond redemption, already
doomed and lost forever.</p>

<p>For such I have taken courage and have pleaded before
the Lord His written Word, asking for their soul's salvation;
and now they are forever with the Lord. O faithless
one, is there anything too hard for the Lord? And has He
not told us "All things are possible to him that believeth"
and "Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out"
and that "if we confess our sins He is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"?
During these years that I have stepped out on His
promises I have proved that His word never fails. It is
faith in the living God which brings results in the salvation
of immortal souls. Never have I doubted God's power
to save the vilest person, and now I want to tell, for His
glory, just a little of what God has wrought as well as
show something of what needs to be done. Bless the Lord,
O my soul, for a faith prompted of the Spirit that will
not waver&mdash;a confidence in God which takes no denial but
cries "It must be done." In answer to such a faith, criminals
of the deepest dye have been awakened and saved and
women of the worst possible character have been converted
and reformed and purified, and some have been set apart
for the service of God and have done a mighty work. Others,
as we have said, have gone to swell the grand, triumphant
strain around the throne of God, where angels and
archangels unite to make all heaven resound with the praises
of our King&mdash;among those of whom it is said, "These are
they which came up through great tribulation and have
washed their robes and made them white in the blood of
the Lamb." After I see the King in His beauty, clothed in
majesty and glory and power, I want to look in the faces
of those whom God has used me to help, who have come up
from inside prison walls and from haunts of sin&mdash;yea, from
the scaffold itself&mdash;those who have died in the triumphs of
a living faith, victorious over death, hell and the grave.</p>

<p>Since my call to the work of the Lord He has caused
many homes to be opened to me and has given me many
very dear friends. Among those of earlier years were
dear Brother and Sister H. L. Hastings, of Boston, who
kindly gave me a home and cared for me in sickness and
special time of need. And in later years are those at the
Missionary Training Home at Tabor, Iowa, with whom I
have made my headquarters since 1895. I would specially
mention Mrs. Hattie Worcester Kelley, who had a call from
God to assist me in prison work and traveled some with
me until her health failed; also Mrs. Georgia Worcester
and her husband, and her father, Elder Weavers, who is
president of the Home; with their faithful helpers in charge
and assisting in the work, who have given me a hearty welcome
among them.</p>

<p>It was here I became more directly interested in foreign
missionary work. I have at different times taken with me
in my prison and slum mission work several of the missionaries
now in foreign lands. Among these are Mr. and Mrs.
Wm. Worcester, now in Africa, whom I accompanied on
their way as far as London; Grace Yarrett, recently sailed
for India, and a number of others.</p>

<h4>FAMILY REUNION AFTER A SEPARATION OF<br />
FIFTY-TWO YEARS.</h4>

<p>The following from a paper published in Elkhart, Ind.,
December, 1902, under the above heading, will explain
itself:</p>

<blockquote><p>J. M. Ryder of Indianapolis, Ind.; Emanuel Ryder of Bryan, O.;
Elizabeth Ryder Wheaton, prison evangelist, and Lida Ryder Hoffman
of this city met in a family reunion Dec. 8, after a separation
of fifty-two years, this being the first time in all these years that
the brothers and sisters, who were left orphans in early childhood,
have been together. * * * The brothers and sisters sat for a
group picture as a memento of the day, and left for their different
missions and homes, not likely to all meet again this side of the
great River.</p></blockquote>

<p>I also give the reader a sketch written by my brother and
published in his home paper at Bryan, O., some years since.</p>

<blockquote><p>Like Moses and the prophets of old; like Jesus and his disciples;
like Martin Luther and John Wesley, and a host of other great
lights who have been chosen at different times to be teachers and
leaders of the children of earth, so in like manner and like purpose
was Elizabeth Ryder Wheaton chosen.</p>

<p>Her chief mission has been to the inmates of jails and penitentiaries,
reformatories and the lowly outcasts in the houses of perdition,
among people who never find room in the pews.</p>

<p>Unconnected with church or other organization, but aided by an
angel band, a Christ love, great charity, force of character that
knew not fear where duty called, she has worked for the uplifting
of the fallen.</p>

<p>For twenty years she has toiled and struggled in her great life
work, giving her teachings, her songs and her prayers, shedding
tears of love and sympathy for the poor souls in the bondage of sin.</p>

<p>For twenty years she has traveled up and down her home land
and several foreign countries.</p>

<p>The world her country, to do good her religion, giving her light,
her life, wherever the most needed; never stopping, except from
sickness or exhaustion from overwork; often meeting friends on
the long and rugged road who gave her sympathy, shelter and food;
at other times the floor her couch and but little to eat&mdash;but whether
good or bad conditions, always thankful.</p>

<p>In her chosen work, in the past twenty years, no person has done
more good or has had so much influence in causing people to lead
better lives, to quit sinning, to get out of hell and enjoy the happiness
that follows from leading conscientious, truer lives.</p>

<p>Her good intentions, her words of warning and sympathy, her
sweet soul songs of love, her prayers in angelic power, have moved
the people outside of the churches in the different avocations and
walks of life as they had never been moved before, the masses perceiving
by subtle agency that here was a person deserving love,
respect and honor.</p>

<p>She had great influence with the employees of the different railway
companies, the good-will of the superintendents of many of the
great railway lines of the country, frequently getting passes from
New York City to San Francisco and return, a distance of seven
thousand miles, for herself and companion.</p>

<p>She has spoken in more reformatories, jails and penitentiaries,
and, I believe, done more good, unconnected with any organization,
than any other in the twenty years.</p>

<h5>HER LIFE HISTORY.</h5>

<p>It is too long a story to attempt to go into details&mdash;to tell of
her trials, hardships and sickness; to tell of her individual successes,
as well as her successes when she has swayed great bodies
of people, moving the half of them to tears, causing them to have
higher thoughts, better motives, and to bless the hour she was
among them; or of how she entered the southern stockades alone,
even when warned by the Warden that her life might be taken, and
in ten minutes had the inmates as tractable as little children, where
the officials would not enter, except in a body and thoroughly armed;
how she stood her ground when menaced by drunken western desperadoes;
or of the times she divided her raiment and her scant
purse with the destitute, and the many times she escaped great danger
by being forewarned, etc.</p>

<p>Bereft of both parents at the age of five years, and cared for by
cold and indifferent strangers, she misses the mother's love, guidance,
sympathy and protection.</p>

<p>When she started out on her mission she left a good home with
all the substantials and many of the luxuries of life, with but little
education, without money or friends, alone to travel unbeaten paths,
to do a work that no one had ever tried before; untrained in the
great work she was to follow, but impelled by a higher Spirit force
she could not resist. "Do this work. I will be with you to the end.
When great troubles come, I will be your shield and your helper. I
will warn you of great danger. I will protect your life. You will
gather many sheaves, and, when you are through with earth, have a
high place in the heavenly abode."</p>

<p>Whenever needed, the angel band assists her to say the right
words for the time and occasion, according to perceptions and conceptions
of the people addressed.</p>

<p>She is gifted with a voice that is always musical, clear and distinct,
and of such compass that it can be heard a mile, or down to
the minor notes, but always with the pathos that touches the tender
chords of the soul.</p>

<p>Now she is old, broken in health and strength. Soon she must
lay her weary body down, a willing sacrifice for the lowest children
of earth.</p>

<p>And now with this brief outline of the work, the life and the
powerful soul magic of Elizabeth Ryder Wheaton, I close.</p>

<h3>A Letter to My Prison Children.</h3>


<p>You, dear ones, are my especial care and have been for
over twenty long years; and your eternal good will continue
in a sense to be first in my thoughts while life lasts.</p>

<p>My own childhood was lonely and desolate. As I have
already told you, my father died when I was one year old,
and mother died when I was only six. I was taken from
my mother's grave by an old man who had, with his wife,
asked mother for me before she died. My stepfather went
to law with my grandfather, who was guardian for myself
and sister, for my father's fortune, and the suit was carried
from one court to another until all was gone and we little
children were penniless.</p>

<p>Sister and I were reared by our grandparents, and were
given a very limited education. We were taught to work
as rigidly as if we were paupers. The experience was hard
but I can now see how good it was for me in after years to
know how to do all kinds of work and be able to do with
my might what my hands found to do.</p>

<p>All my life I have known much of <small>SORROW AND DISAPPOINTMENT</small>.
It has seemed that I have never been allowed
to keep long anything that I loved. When I was a child,
my pets would sicken and die, and the friends that I loved
best would either move away from me or die; and my heart
was being continually crushed and broken by these trials.</p>

<p>I loved to learn and was passionately fond of music, but
I was not permitted to gratify my desires in either direction.
Why all this was true, I know not, unless it was that
I might learn deeper lessons of sympathy and compassion
for others that are in trouble.</p>

<p>Perhaps, dear ones, because of these very experiences I
can feel more deeply and tenderly for you and I want to tell
you that amid all the sorrows of earth I have found <em>one
Friend</em> that has never forgotten or forsaken me and that
has promised never to leave me. <em>And this same Jesus loves
you.</em> If you but give Him your hearts He will never fail
you. Though all the world should forsake and despise you,
Jesus loves you just the same.</p>

<p>It is He that has put into my heart this love for you and
your souls' salvation that I cannot explain; this love that
grows deeper and stronger and that can only be made plain
in the judgment. He has taught me to feel for you when
you are forsaken and forgotten, when even friends turn
away because you are doomed to the prison cell, the stripes,
and even the scaffold.</p>

<p>Often you are misunderstood and misjudged, and sometimes
you grow bitter towards every one, and sometimes
you censure your best friends. I plead with you to look
on the bright side. Think of all God has done for you and
how wonderful it is that He loves you with all your sins,
that He loves your precious, immortal souls.</p>

<p>You are my children. For Jesus' sake, and yours, I am
a homeless wanderer on earth. I have given up home and
friends and have gone into the darkest places of earth, and
have endured hardships and faced danger of every kind. I
have endured untold sorrow of mind and heart. I have wept
and prayed night and day, and for you I have sacrificed all.</p>

<p>But dear ones, notwithstanding all this, I am happy in the
love of Jesus. His love is everything to my heart. His
love and sympathy is enough for me, and I know that He is
able to provide all that I need. He has kept me nearly
sixty years, and I am sure that He will not now forsake me.</p>

<p>Let this encourage you, dear prisoners, to know that
God loves and cares for you. When the way looks the
darkest, when all hope fails, when the last friend has forsaken
you, then look up to Jesus and believe His word. I
know your trials are hard to bear. I think of you as you
leave the jail for the penitentiary with the handcuffs on and
the sheriff and the deputy guarding you so closely, and the
world against you. I think of you as the prison doors close
behind you. I think of you in your loneliness as the days
and months and perhaps years go by, and again I say, yes, I
know your trials are hard to bear. But look up through
the dark clouds and remember that God lives and that He
loves you. In your little lonely prison cell He is with
you and is waiting to save you. Do not conceal your sins,
for God's Word says, "He that covereth his sin shall not
prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall
find mercy."</p>

<p>Let the past be cleansed by the blood of Jesus. If you
trust Him, He has promised to separate your sins as far
from you as the east is from the west. Do not rest until
His Spirit tells you this is done. Then, "forgetting the
things that are behind," press forward to those things
that are before.</p>

<p>Obey the rules. Show by your daily life that you intend
to do right, the very best you know. If those in authority
over you seem to be unkind or unjust, bear what comes as
brave soldiers. Even inside of prison walls you can win
glorious victories over self and sin.</p>

<p>There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth. I
seek to show you the way to the kingdom of heaven, where
there is no more temptation, no sin, no sorrow, no pain;
to the place where Jesus has gone to prepare a home for
those who love Him, follow Him and trust Him.</p>

<p>My heart yearns over you in your sad exile from wife,
children, mother, father, husband, brother, sister, friends.
Truly the way of the transgressor is hard.</p>

<p>But, my prison children, I beg of you do not go from
one prison to another. Flee from sin. I do not and dare
not smooth over your sins. Prove yourselves worthy of
the confidence of good people. Give God your hearts and
be true to Him and He will not forsake you.</p>

<p>Some of you are doomed to the scaffold! How long, O
Lord, how long must such things be in a Christian land?
O, that I had the power to abolish capital punishment!
But I will do all I can to help you prepare for death. Jesus
loves you. He was taken from prison and executed as a
criminal. He was innocent, yet He suffered death for a
guilty world. He was tempted in all points like as we are,
yet without sin. "And being tempted, He is able to succor
them that are tempted." And though you pass through the
valley of the shadow of death, if you but trust Him, He will
go with you and you need fear no evil.</p>

<h4>A LETTER TO PRISON OFFICERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Prison Managers</span>: You and I are trying to help
the prisoners to a better life. We want to elevate, to lift up
these men and women to a higher plane of existence. How
are you to proceed? What are you to do, is the question.
How are you to command the respect of those under you?
Just where to draw the line, and how to enforce discipline?
What advantage will you give to the men who are striving
to obey rules, and do what is right? Something must be
done, and done soon. The criminal classes must be reached,
reformed, saved and sent out of prison better prepared to
face the world and the temptations which will be thrust upon
them at every turn. Great responsibility rests upon you.
Many of you are doing nobly and accomplishing great good.</p>

<p>There is hope for every prisoner. You can reach them
by kindness. Brutality will never accomplish anything in
the way of prison reform. By such a course a man is often
turned out of prison a demon, a fiend in human form, or an
idiotic criminal.</p>

<p>But to make him a good man, a noble creature, as God
intended he should be, he must have kindness shown him.
Be <em>firm</em> and <em>honorable</em> in all your dealings with the convict,
for he has his rights, and they should be respected if we
are ever going to make the prison world better.</p>

<p>Let us ask God for help to know how to reach the manhood,
the womanhood, the better nature in the creature God
has seen fit in His wise providence to make just a little lower
than the angels, in His own likeness and image. He intended
all should be free and equal, but the people license
the saloon, the gambling den and the brothel to degrade their
brothers and sisters. Some say these are necessary evils!
I say never, never! Let there be better conditions.</p>

<p>There is hope for the sinner if we only get the Holy
Spirit to teach us how to reach him. I never go into the
presence of convicts without earnest prayer to God to give
me wisdom, and the Holy Spirit to teach and guide me
what to say and sing, and how to reach their hearts. God
has given me what success I have had in helping the criminal
classes, in giving hope to the discouraged and in relieving
the minds of some who were partially deranged. Oh,
this wholesale slaughter of men's minds! It is horrible. It
is heart-rending. And yet some go right on committing
the greatest crime against these men, by robbing them of
their reason which God intended them to enjoy as their
birthright.</p>

<p>Which is the greater crime, the whipping post and the
lash with all their attendant horrors and misery, or the iron
rule that crushes out all hope in the name of discipline? I
believe in law and order, and that men must be in subjection
to rules and regulations. I always urge upon them implicit
obedience and subjection to the rules of the prison. But
these should be reasonable and humane.</p>

<p>What you and I need is to know our man and then we
will know how to deal with him. Study human nature as
well as the law, and study the law of the all-wise God in
the Bible and see if you will not have a clear conscience as
well as a clear brain to manage and control those under your
direction.</p>

<p>I know prisons that are regulated entirely by kindness,
and oh, the blessed, restful, quieting influence there is there,
and scarcely any insane. All are satisfied with the treatment
they receive and they are willing to die for their officers.
I know these things, for I am behind the scenes.</p>

<p>After long years of service as a prison missionary, in
nearly all the state prisons in all the states and territories,
I find only an ever increasing desire to be a worker together
with Christ in reaching the masses of prisoners who are
incarcerated in our state, county and city prisons. My success
has largely been due to my sincere and intense desire
to lead them to a better life here and life eternal in heaven,
and to the victory gained over myself to never let anything
or anybody prevent my doing all I could for the prisoner,
as if he were my own child or brother. Again, my determination
has been to give all a fair trial and a liberal amount
of confidence. Yes, we must place ourselves in their condition;
let our boy or brother, our mother or sister be in
prison, let us think how we would exercise every means we
had in reaching or relieving them.</p>

<p>All prisoners are human, and yet, how few professors
of religion show interest in them. They are doubted at
every turn. Daggers are driven to hearts which are longing
for a better life, a purer atmosphere, a new creation.
Poor souls! God pity them. O the hearts that cry out for
better things! the souls that are yearning for the good and
true! O the thousands of prisoners who may be diamonds
in the rough, jewels for whom Christ died. Souls, immortal
souls are at stake. We must soon meet these things at
the judgment. O to be clear of the censure, the rebuke,
the reproof of God Almighty in the final day of accounts.</p>

<p>O brother, sister, have we had charity that suffereth long
and is kind? Have we tried by example and precept to
show the criminals that we were really their friends and
sincerely cared for their souls? How long has the good
Lord borne with us, and shall we not be in earnest to save
those who are not Christians, to encourage them to a better
life, to cheer up the dying convict, to show them there is a
God in Israel who hears and answers prayer, one who said,
"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth
them that fear Him"?</p>

<h4>PREJUDICE.</h4>

<p>I find but little difference between humanity in prison walls
and the humanity outside. Prisoners are our brothers and
our sisters. We must soon meet them all at the judgment.
They are naturally supposed to be guilty of crime of some
kind. But they are not all criminals. Wicked men, willing
to shield themselves, oftentimes throw suspicion on others,
who are placed under arrest and convicted by circumstantial
evidence or false testimony. Others, of course, are
of the worst types of humanity. Some of them seem unworthy
of the name of man or woman, yet even these Christ
died to save, and God is able to deliver them and how shall
His name be better glorified or His power be more manifest,
than in their transformation?</p>

<p>Very many are so prejudiced against all those who are
counted as criminals that they believe them to be utterly
incapable of any good and are quick to believe that they
see in them evidences of the deepest depravity.</p>

<p>A sad yet amusing illustration of this fact comes to my
mind. Chaplain H., of the Reformatory for Boys at Kearney,
Nebraska, is an honest-faced, true-hearted young man,
full of zeal in the service of God. At one time when I
stopped at Kearney he called for me at the train. As I
looked at him he said, with a smile, "Did you think it was
one of the boys whom the superintendent had sent for you?"
I replied, "Yes; I did at first; you are so young, Mr. Chaplain;"
and then he related to me the following circumstances
which I give as nearly as I can in his own words:</p>

<blockquote><p>"At one time Prof. Mallalieu and myself had been to Lincoln on
business, and were returning together. We were quietly resting,
and I was sitting with closed eyes, meditating, when a lady happened
along and recognized the Superintendent, and said 'Have
you got a boy there, taking him to the Reform Schools?'</p>

<p>"Considerably amused, he replied: 'Yes; this is a very bad
fellow; I have had a lot of trouble with him, and have just recaptured
him, and now I am watching to see that he doesn't make his
escape.' The woman leaned over and, scanning my face and features,
said: 'He has an awful bad look on his face; you can see he
is a criminal and needs to be under strict discipline.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The dear young chaplain said, as he laughingly related
this instance, that he learned a lesson in human nature that
day. That woman, who imagined that she saw in the face
of that young looking, honest, devoted Christian young man
evidences of guilt and depravity, was only one among thousands
who are led by prejudice when they imagine that they
are exercising great discernment.</p>


<h4>A LOOK INTO THE CELL.</h4>

<p>Reader, could you and I walk together down the cell-house
corridor in almost any of our large prisons, at almost
any hour of the night and pause and listen to the sighs and
smothered sobs and often to the deep groans that might be
heard welling up from hearts that are broken and crushed
by sorrow and remorse; could we, dear reader, cast one
sidelong glance in passing the rounds of the cell-house with
the guard, who, with muffled tread wends his ceaseless
march throughout the night, your heart, as well as mine,
would be deeply moved. On those stone floors, guarded
by double locks and iron bars, as well as by the living sentinel,
you might see many a mother's boy kneeling in silent
prayer to his mother's God, and as he prays and communes
with his own thoughts, you might hear again the groans of
anguish as the poor unfortunate thinks of home and mother,
wife and children, or other loved ones.</p>

<p>Then look with me into that poor man's cell, void of comfort,
with nothing that would remind you of home; a close
narrow cell, a poor hard cot, a straw pillow, if any, and kept
under strict watch day and night; left many times without
one ray of hope, without a gleam of sunshine or a kind
word. I wonder there are not scores of insane men in our
state prisons for every one that we find, and there are many,
very many, who are either partially or entirely insane. I am
convinced that oftentimes men are crazy when the officers
suppose they are only obstinate and rebellious and mean.
Often do I note insanity lurking in the eyes and often as
the prisoners file past me at the close of a service and I
clasp each one by the hand, as is my custom, among the
many who are so glad to have a kind word and a hand-clasp
at parting I notice those who are not sane by the
peculiarity of the clasp of the hand. Some have a clasp
like a mad-man, others a limp, lifeless hand-shake, with cold,
clammy hands. Oh, what wisdom is needed to know how
to deal with these poor, helpless souls! I find many of them
with hearts as tender and sensibilities as acute as any I
meet outside.</p>


<h4>INSANE PRISONERS.</h4>

<p>While I was having a service for the criminal insane at
Anamosa, Iowa, state prison, a young man was very anxious
to see me and tell me something. As I waited to talk with
him he said to me in <em>such a pitiful way</em>, "Go and tell my
dear mother I will try to help her. Won't somebody help
my poor mother?" This was the burden of his heart. Poor
boy! in his partial derangement his whole concern seemed to
be for her. He is only one among many!</p>

</div>


<h4>A TOUCHING INCIDENT.</h4>

<p>At one time I was on the train going north from Indianapolis.
My brother, J. M. Ryder, was with me. I was
singing a hymn, and walking to the end of the car as I sang
I saw two men bound together by handcuffs. One of them
I supposed to be an officer. He was a fine looking man,
well dressed. It was a few days before Christmas, but I
noticed some holly-berries pinned to his coat. I remarked,
"You have holly-berries before Christmas day!" With tears
rolling down his face he answered, "My little girl pinned
this on me. She said, 'Papa, you will not be here when
Christmas comes, and I will pin it on now before you go.'"</p>

<p>I said, "You are an officer, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he said, "I am a prisoner," and then he told
me his sad story. Money belonging to some one else, a
relative, if I remember rightly, had been left in his care.
Under pressure of need he used some of it, being confident
that he could replace it before it was needed; but the shortage
was discovered, he was arrested, found guilty and sentenced.
With a broken heart he said, "I never will live to
serve out my sentence. This will surely kill me. I am not
a thief, but I was so sure I could replace the money before
it was needed."</p>

<p>Reader, think you this man was any more a criminal at
heart than thousands who move among men honored and
respected? Who can question that there are thousands
who, perhaps, do not transgress the letter of the law, yet
more deliberately and wilfully wrong their fellow men than
this poor man? And this case is only one of many; and
where shall we draw the line? Oh, let us have fervent
charity one for another.</p>

<p>I am not biased in my judgment. I know sentimentalism
is not salvation. That can come only through true repentance
and faith in God and must be evidenced by restitution
and good works; but if you could see, as I have seen, the
meetings in the prison guard-room between husband and
wife, mother and son, or between father and his wayward
boy, if you could see the tears and sobs as they meet and
part, and above all at the last parting before execution, I
believe you would never feel like criticising or being harsh
in your judgment again. Could you have gone with me
during these twenty years, could you have had the confidence
of these prisoners as I have had it, you would realize
that they are, in very many cases, as truly open to conviction
and as easily reached as those outside of prison walls,
and are they not my children? Do I not know their faults?
Do they not confess to me their guilt? But back of all I
see Jesus hanging on the cross of Calvary, between two
thieves, dying, and in His death agony, while the blood is
oozing from the print of the thorns upon His brow, while the
eyes are growing glassy in death, with the cold death sweat
standing out upon His face, I hear Him say to the penitent
thief, "This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise." And
again, as He remembers all those who have so cruelly
wronged Him, he cries, "Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do." If the Son of God gave Himself
for us, if with His dying breath He prayed for His persecutors,
if He who knew no sin and understood all hearts
could say, "They know not what they do," God help us to
be willing to forgive those who have transgressed the law
either of God or man.</p>

<p>These prisoners need a helping hand, need a friend with
wisdom, tact and judgment, one in whose heart there is the
one thought above all others of the need of their immortal
souls, their eternal destiny.</p>

<p>You and I, reader, must do our part in reforming a lost
world, in saving lost sinners. Then let us remember how
good God has been to us by keeping us out of prison, by
keeping us out of the evil surroundings and influences that
might have brought us there. Let us give the poor prisoners
a fair show and fair play. Many of them long for better
things, for one more chance to prove themselves worthy
of the confidence and sympathy of their fellow men. After
twenty years of toil among those who are bound, I do bless
God that He ever called me to carry to those in prison the
glad message of His love and seek by love and faith and
prayer to lift them up to better things.</p>


<h4>PREPARED TO DIE.</h4>

<p>Once while holding services in a prison, there came to
me a prisoner saying, "Mother, I want to tell you I was
saved since I saw you." (Only a few days previous.)</p>

<p>Then he told me that he was under sentence of death and
that he was so troubled that he cried to God to forgive his
sins and pardon his crime, and that God had forgiven him
and that he was now prepared to die. He said that when
the Lord forgave him he was so happy that the officers put
an extra guard over him, thinking that he had suddenly
lost his mind.</p>

<p>I exhorted him to maintain his faith in God and never
doubt His saving power; to walk softly before God; to keep
humble and meek and pray much. Truly there is pardon
for every sinner who, in the depths of his soul, repents of
his sin. God's love and power are so great that He will
save to the uttermost all that come unto Him, not willing
that any should perish.</p>

<p>Reader, perhaps you have not the opportunity to know
these souls as I know them, and so to help you understand
them I give in other chapters many extracts in their own
words, taken here and there from the thousands of letters I
have received. I believe this will help you to understand
that hundreds, shut out from the companionship of their
fellow beings, are as easily moved by kindness, as capable
of gratitude, as easily won to repentance, as willing to give
up sin, as thousands of those outside, who perhaps have
never been tempted as they were tempted and have never
fallen as they have fallen. In quoting from these letters
few changes have been made, except in spelling, capitalization
and punctuation.</p>

<h3>A Brief Pen Picture of Prison Life.</h3>


<p>For the instruction of children and others who have never
visited one of our large penitentiaries I insert the following
sketch of such a visit written by Mrs. F. M. Lambert, author
of "Holy Maternity," which was written for this work:</p>

<blockquote><p>The prisons and buildings connected with them are enclosed by a
high stone wall. Of course there is a gate, or gates, opening upon
driveways leading into the yard where the shops are located. The
gate is securely locked and guarded, the guard having a little
room built on the wall over the gate. There is a main entrance to
the building through which criminals as well as visitors enter. The
officer closes and locks the large door behind you upon entering. On
Sabbath mornings many things are seen and heard there. The officers
come in and take up the work of the day. The warden or
deputy takes a large bunch of keys and opens a side door that leads
into the cell room, and the guards follow him into the corridor.
Soon is heard the rattling of the keys, and the opening and closing
of heavy doors, followed by the tramp, tramp, of many feet. Passing
out at a side door with the officer, you may watch the men passing
down to their breakfast in the dining-room, which is on the ground
floor of the chapel, perhaps one hundred feet from the prison building.</p>

<p>Each guard marches with his company of men, from twenty to
fifty in number. They march in single file, each man with his right
hand resting upon the right shoulder of the man in front of him.</p>

<p>The officers wear dark blue uniforms, while the convicts are
dressed in suits made of heavy woolen goods, generally striped, the
stripes being black and white, a little over an inch wide, even the
caps being striped, and of the same material as the suits.</p>

<p>You follow the officer across the yard, and notice the large greenhouse
with its beautiful plants, flowers and shrubs. But, looking
back, you see the great high wall of the prison, and remember that
the little spot in the prison yard and the sky overhead is all the
glimpse of the world that these poor men get, and, no doubt, is all
that some of them ever will get, for some of them are shut in there
for life.</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Dining" id="Dining"></a>
<img src="images/ill-p060.jpg" width="600" height="391" alt="PRISON CHAPEL AND DINING ROOM." title="PRISON CHAPEL AND DINING ROOM." />
<span class="caption">PRISON CHAPEL AND DINING ROOM.</span>
</div>


<h4>THE CHAPEL SERVICE.</h4>

<blockquote><p>You follow the officer up the steps of stone into the entrance
hall, and watch the men pass out of the dining-room up the stairway
into the chapel; then you follow and are led to a seat near the
pulpit, facing the assemblage. Your eyes wander quickly over that
strange lot of from two hundred to five hundred men, and, in some
prisons, over a thousand constitute the audience. When all are seated,
the guards seat themselves on high stools placed along the sides of
the room, facing the rear door, while the prisoners face the pulpit
at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>Then the prison choir sings and the organ peals forth its beautiful
strains, the prisoners joining in the singing. You cannot keep
back the tears as you look into their faces and think that only for
sin they might be free. Verily, "the way of the transgressor is
hard." Prayer is offered, and the chaplain, and those who have
permission, talk from the written word of eternal life. Invariably
your eyes sweep over that strange audience, and here and there you
see a man, or perhaps a young boy, in tears, and you know the tender
chord in their hearts has been touched. God grant it may be so!
Several testify to hope in Christ.</p>

<p>Services over, the prisoners are marched to their cells and locked
in. They must all attend the morning service, but are not compelled
to attend the Sunday school in the afternoon. Few prisons conduct
Sunday schools. In the afternoon, in company with the chaplain and
some of the guards, you may visit the cell rooms, and are allowed to
distribute papers and tracts, and speak personally with each prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The cell room</span> is a long room with a stone floor and whitewashed
walls, the cells running through the middle of its entire length. The
cells are narrow, little rooms, perhaps four feet wide and six or seven
feet long. They vary somewhat in size. They have doors of strong
bars of iron, and no windows. All the air received must enter
through this grated door in front. The back of each cell joins with
the back of the row of cells on the other side, thus forming a double
row facing in opposite directions.</p>

<p>Rows of cells are built in tiers, one row above another, with a narrow
platform running along in front, with an iron railing.</p>

<p>Each man's name, and the number of his cell, is placed over his
door. A wide corridor runs all around the main room, which admits
the circulation of air from the large grated windows. Sabbath is
rather a hard day for the men, for they had rather be at work than
locked in lonely cells, with only their own thoughts and troubled
consciences for company.</p>

<p>Many of the men who are there for long terms have their cells
fixed very nicely, and one can usually tell those whose hearts cling to
home or friends. But there are some who seem to care for nothing.
One boy had his cell ornamented with festoons of newspapers folded
and torn into patterns representing lace curtains. Another, a life
convict, had his cell festooned with colored tissue paper. This man
was a trusty, who had the care of the flowers and plants. In some
prisons the cells are not provided with Bibles, and some prisons have
no chaplains.</p>

<p>Some of the men are very expert at making beautiful things, such
as pin cushions, picture frames, hair-braided watch guards, pen-holders,
workboxes, toy chairs and many other things. One man I
saw was making designs for embossed rocking-chair backs; another
had his tools for repairing watches.</p>

<span class="caption">CORRIDOR IN CELL HOUSE.</span>
</div>


<h4>THE WORKSHOPS.</h4>

<p>On Monday morning we may visit the workshops and see the men
at work. Here we see all kinds of work; farm implements, such as
hoes, rakes, pitchforks and many other things, probably all made of
iron. These tools pass through many hands before they are complete.
Each process is done by a separate set of men. For instance, the
hoes are made by some and sharpened by others. It takes only a
few seconds to sharpen a tool. As soon as this is done it is passed
on to others who polish it, and the handle is inserted and painted.</p>

<p>Some rooms are so warm from the many furnaces, and the red-hot
irons which are being beaten into shape, that a person can scarcely
stay long enough to see the work done, and is glad to move
on to cooler departments. The men seem to look well, but you
cannot help wondering how they ever work and endure the terrible
heat. They are not allowed to talk to each other, and are continually
under the guard's eye. Here and there one looks up with a nod
and a smile.</p>

<p>Each man in the shops is given a certain amount of work to do,
and if he does any more than his allotted task, he is paid for it.
The amount is kept for him. But very few except long-timers and
experts can gain any time to do extra work.</p>

<p>After going through all the shops we pass on to</p>


<h4>THE HOSPITAL,</h4>

<p>which is in the rear of the chapel, and in the same building. Here
are sights that touch hearts. Some are dying with consumption, and
some with broken hearts. One poor boy's sunken cheeks and thin,
wasted hands especially touched me. Taking him by the hand, I
began to talk to him. He said: "No one cares for <em>me</em>." "Yes,
God cares for you and He loves you." "Why does He let me stay
here and die if He loves me?" "Have you a mother?" "Yes, I
have a good Christian mother, but she doesn't know I am here."
"May I write and tell her you are sick? I am sure she wants to
know about you?" "Oh, no; I had rather die all alone than to
have mother know I am here."</p>

<p>So it is all through these places. For, though I have briefly
described one prison, they are all in a great measure alike, yet vary
in different states to some extent. All are not so clean and neat as
this one spoken of, and though a prison might be lined with costly
gems, it is still a prison, and without Jesus in the heart it is only a
living tomb to those confined therein. Let none think that it is a
pleasant place to be. One man may want to be a Christian, or at
least a moral man and a man of cultured tastes, and such men find
it doubly hard when they must work side by side with the most
degraded criminals. One may leave the prison worse than when he
went in.</p>

<p>In these places children hide their ruined lives and breaking hearts
from their dearest earthly friends. No mother to smooth the dying
one's pillow, though small it may be! No sister or brother to wipe
away the bitter tears that <em>will</em> fall; no father to say good-bye. O
mothers, let the memory of your boy's innocent childhood fan all
your tenderness and love into a flame that would leap over the
highest breastwork Satan could erect and take your boy or girl back
to your heart. If you have been a true Christian and have done your
duty faithfully, trust still in God. What we need is faithful teaching
among the unsaved, to warn them against their danger, before
they get into such awful places.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Letters of Introduction and Kind Words from Governors,
Prison Officials, Etc.</h3>


<p>From the great number of letters which I have received,
of the character indicated by the title of this chapter, I give
a few which may be of interest to the reader. These will
suffice to show the general interest of those in positions of
honor and trust and their willingness to share a part in the
work I have tried to perform for humanity, by making it
possible for me to prosecute and carry it on. Many letters
of like topic have been lost or destroyed, and, space being
limited, I hope those who have done a like part may not
feel slighted. The true records are kept by the recording
angel, and every one shall receive a just reward. "Inasmuch

<p>Such letters received in the Southern states will be found
in the chapters on work in Stockades and Prison Camps.
Also some relating to Street and Rescue work in the chapters
on these respective topics. I should like very much to
give some personal letters from railway officials, expressing
their appreciation and interest in the work, but I have
refrained lest by such some might be caused some annoyance.
To them much gratitude and credit is due, from all

<blockquote><p>"Crime among boys and young men has increased greatly during
the last few years. I cannot account for this except on the ground
of a noticeable increase in the social high pressure.</p>

<p>"The temptations today are greater than ever and swamp the

meet these boys in prison&mdash;white and colored&mdash;and talk to them. I
find out their needs and try to help them.</p>

<p>"Nowhere in the wide world can the power of sin be more clearly
seen than in the Tombs Prison. It is a wreckage pool where hulks
and derelicts that have been abandoned in the ocean of life come
to a standstill. What an army of fallen humanity! They can go
no further. When they realize their condition they weep, groan and
bitterly lament over their misspent lives. Can these men be transformed
by the power of the Gospel? These moral and physical
wrecks, with bleared eyes, sunken and emaciated cheeks and many
other marks of sin. What a besotted multitude! Yet the Gospel
of Jesus can reach them. 'He can save to the uttermost all that
come unto God through Him.'"</p></blockquote>

<h3>Some of My Prison Boys.</h3>


<p>The writer of the following letters was one of the most
remarkably conscientious persons I ever knew. As a prisoner,
he was very highly respected by the officers. His
chaplain has ever remained his sincere friend and counselor.
Years have passed since he left prison life and he
still remains an earnest Christian and an honorable member
of society. No one but his pastor, employer and former
friends know his past history.</p>

<p>He was converted in prison during services I held in 1884
or 1885. He presented me some years ago with a book of
poems of his own writing. Not being able to carry them
with me, I have lost trace of them. Otherwise would be
glad to furnish some of them to my readers.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<blockquote><p>
To Mrs. Wheaton, My Dear Mother in the Lord:
</p>

<p>I call you by this name because I am young and have lost my
mother in the flesh, and I am writing this letter because, as you
have given up all for Jesus' sake, you only can help me as I wish.
You can pray for me as a mother prays for a son. I am twenty-four
years old, have an eighteen years' sentence, have served four
years of it and expect to serve the whole of it for I have no influential
friends to help me.</p>

<p>I had not been here a year until I realized what eighteen years
of prison life meant&mdash;the deprivation of all earthly pleasures, and
the wasting away of youthful hopes and ambitions in vain regret.
Grief, misery and despair overwhelmed me every night, and every
night I wished that I were dead. A great struggle was going on in
my soul. A struggle for either life or death, and, thank God, life
had the victory.</p>

<p>I am now a Christian. A night of revelation came to me in which
God, as Judge, and Jesus, as Saviour, revealed to me&mdash;the one, the
power and glory; the other, the love of God.</p>

<p>But my way is not like the peaceful flow of a river, but like a
stream of cascades. By leaps I draw nearer to God. In the meantime
I do not keep the image of Jesus before me. Pray, dear
mother, this special prayer for me, that my faith may be constant;
that self shall no more come between it and Jesus; that surroundings
shall not weaken it; that youth shall not neglect it. Jesus
has stamped my soul with his blood. It can never be effaced, but
my soul does not thrill as often as I wish with the joy of right-doing.
Belief in Jesus permeates my whole being. Why do I sometimes
stray from his love? Repentance is doubly grievous then,
and repent I must. My conscience compels me. The prayers of a
saintly woman will be heard. You will pray for me for Jesus'
sake.</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Thanksgiving Day, 1885.</p>

<p>Dear Mother in the Lord:
</p>

<p>With what mingled emotions of joy, gratitude and love, I read
your faith inspiring letter. I did not expect it, for one Sunday in
the chapel the Chaplain read one from you addressed to us all in
general. He also told us something about your way&mdash;what a lonely,
weary way. What a sorrow yours has been! Can we poor mortals
ever forget our sorrow? Does it not rise to the surface at times and
overwhelm us, so that nothing but the soothing presence of Jesus
can comfort us? "I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to
you."</p>

<p>A common saying here is: "I don't believe in a man coming to
prison to reform." Ah! little they know what reform is, for where
on earth does one need the Spirit that reforms more than in prison?
Our poets tell us that prisons are the types of hell. I bless God
for bringing me to this prison. Out of its depths I cried and He
heard me, nor do I pray to be free from its thrall. Indeed I do
pray for His will to be done in me and beseech Him to keep me
here until He calls me to Himself, rather than I should go free
again and forget Him. That I never can. Though I fell to the
lowest depths, I could never forget Him. Dear Mother, we will
meet Him&mdash;Jesus&mdash;in Heaven. Oh! I do not want the pleasures of
this life! I do want to be, like you, His humble follower. How
I wish I could be near you always that your faith might ever
increase my own. I need, very much I need, the pure and tender
influence of a holy praying "mother." My own mother had a
loving heart, but neither she nor my father did I ever see praying.
My precious Saviour was never revealed to me from the lips of
either. What would have become of me had God deferred this
discipline? Would I not have gone on in sin until too late, even
had I been sent here for a short term of years? My only thought
would be for them to end, that I might pursue again the delusive
hopes of sin.</p>

<p>I fully realize my position here. I see the providence of God
that makes it a blessing.</p>

<p>I would tell you the way Jesus came to me, or rather how I came
to Him. When first I came here I did not think of what was in
store for me&mdash;eighteen years of prison life. I was wild and thoughtless.
The strangeness of the place helped to divert my mind, but
the solitude of my cell at night forced me to look into the future.
At length my fate dawned upon me. Oh! it was terrible! During
the day I would try to forget the thoughts of the night by being
more wild than ever, but the night brought the ordeal again and it
was driving me to despair. I longed to be dead, but one night the
thought came: "Suppose you were dead, what then? Would you
be at rest?" I say thought, but if ever the Holy Spirit spoke to
the soul of man, it spoke to mine that night. In an instant I saw
the enormity of my sins and the punishment in store for me. In
terror I cried: "O, what shall I do? Oh, I cannot die! I cannot
meet this doom!" Need I say that my cry was not in vain? No,
the spirit of Jesus taught me of Himself that night, and the Chaplain
showed me some words in the gospel of John. I never read
the Bible before, but there were Christ's words, and those words I
now read often. The Psalms and St. John contain for me the Way
of Life.</p>

<p>I do not forget you in my feeble prayers morning and night, and
I hope you will be indeed my "Mother" for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>My Dear Friend and Spiritual Mother:
</p>

<p>I thank you very much for your kind letter, which I received
today. I pray that you may die in the harness, leaving your work
to just pass over the river into Heaven.</p>

<p>Have you heard that our dear Chaplain's helpmeet has recently
taken this journey? The Chaplain takes it just as one would expect
he would, calmly, with faith unabated, rather increased, for he said
to me the day after the funeral: "The peace of God in my heart
passeth understanding." This evidence of real trust in God's mercy,
and that He is and heaven is, has been the means of bringing me
nearer to God.</p>

<p>I am reading a book by "H. W. S." entitled "Frank: the
Record of a Happy Life." It is very inspiring. I have been
convinced for some time that the higher Christian life was a
reality, and had experienced its blessings. But I lived upon
the experience, drawing my strength from it and not God,
consequently I soon got back to where I was before. But the Holy
Spirit has of late been urging me to seek it again, so that I have
consecrated myself anew to the Lord, and he has blessed me wonderfully,
taking away the irritable feeling that certain trials were
sure to bring me. I forget self and think only of doing good
to those who before I felt like shunning. It makes me very
humble in my happiness. Dear Mother, I am sure you have enjoyed
this blessed experience of living moment by moment to God, being
kept by Him from all sin and the power of temptation.</p>

<p>I have read that many Christians do not believe that the
blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin. This appears very strange to me.
I don't see how they can be so blind. When this blessed thought
was shown me I could not help believing it, it seemed so plain, and
was really needful for us to have in order to live up to the commands
of the gospel.</p>

<p class="head">
Tuesday P. M., 17th.
</p>

<p>They are celebrating the Battle of Bunker Hill today. We have
had our holiday and are now in our rooms for the rest of the day.
It is a perfect summer day, mild, with a refreshing breeze floating
through the windows. My bird hangs above me chirping, enjoying
himself, while the murmur of voices in the guard room, with now
and then the joyous shout of a baby, make me feel like shutting
my eyes and imagining myself far away from these stones and bars.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that an educated Christian who is wholly consecrated
shall be used by the Lord where an uneducated one would
not. You know it was to Paul, the highly educated, that was intrusted
the greatest work of the Apostles, viz: To convert the
heathen world. In Athens, the center of intellectual life, he
preached, quoting to them from their own poets and converting certain
philosophers of whom was Dionysius, one of the city's judges.
Intellectual ability is a talent which the Lord requires us to use for
His kingdom. We need never fear for education, "While near the
school the church spire stands," as the Quaker poet, Whittier,
puts it.</p>

<p>Our prayer meeting is growing both in numbers and in interest.
We hold an election of officers today. I resigned the leadership
owing to my duties in the library being such that I could not
attend regularly. I, however, accepted the place of chairman of
the standing committee. The Warden has allowed the teachers of
the night school to organize a society for the purpose of general
culture. Last Friday the constitution and by-laws were submitted
for approval. Next Friday the election of officers will be held.
I have been embarrassed by several members asking me to accept
the position of president. I know that I am not qualified for the
position, but they think otherwise and are persistent. These, and
other tokens of regard and respect for me by my fellow prisoners, I
am very grateful for.</p>

<p>It makes me feel, too, that my Christian life here has not been
without results among them. They respect my scruples&mdash;something
I hardly think people outside are in the habit of doing. You will
understand that I look upon all this as the Lord's doings, and feel
no self-praise over it. To Him be all the praise for giving me the
courage and strength to let my light shine before the men in this
prison. O! it is good to be on the Lord's side, to let Him order my
way. I pray that I may never have a will of my own in this respect.
I feel so perfectly willing to remain here and serve Him in my
feeble way, only praying that if a larger opportunity comes to me
I shall not be found wanting, only believing that with the opportunity
will come added strength and power from on high. The
Holy Spirit has so witnessed to my spirit that God is and that He
is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him, and that Jesus is
my Saviour, that the bare thought of being unfaithful brings intense
pain to my soul. No, I can never be happy away from my Saviour.
With His faith filling my being, His peace shall abide with me.</p>

<p>I pray daily for my spiritual "Mother," that the Lord shall
bless her in all heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that the Holy Spirit
shall rest upon you, giving you the word of truth to speak to the
lost souls in all the places you go to.</p>

<h4>A TALENTED YOUNG MAN.</h4>

<p>Soon after entering upon prison work, I found in one of
our eastern prisons the writer of the following letters and
articles. He was at that time young, gifted, scholarly and
very prepossessing in appearance. His penmanship was
beautiful, perhaps the most so I have ever seen, but he had
fallen under evil influences and the very gift that should
have been used for a better purpose proved a curse and at
the time I first saw him he was under sentence for forgery.
He seemed to be clearly converted in a meeting I held in
the prison and proved faithful during the remainder of his
term. But after he went out into the world I lost trace of
him. He was only one among thousands who need sympathy
and help and encouragement. I trust that, if living,
he is still true to himself and to God. Some of his letters
follow, also the discourse on the Agony in the Garden in
the form of a letter found in the appendix is of his writing.</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">

<p>Madame: Not being able to shake hands, and having thus been

<p>Dear Lady, yours is a special task. In your field of labor are
gathered crowds unnumbered, inert, inanimate, forming, as it were,
a great desert, a Dead Sea uninhabited by any living thing. There
lies a small world to be reconquered; such are the men who are to
be reclaimed. How act upon them? How move their hearts? How
gain mastery over them? In these questions lies the secret of the
future.</p>

<p>Holiness in your heart and the omnipotent hand of Jesus in
yours cannot fail to bring about the reformation of a host of criminals.
He will save them. Oh! climb the heights, display the
brilliancy of those universal truths in whose presence every being
gifted with reason and accessible to reflection feels compelled to
bend the knee. Deeds, examples, striking evidence and incontestable
proofs of abnegation, devotedness, charity and sacrifices are
required. These are the sermons that awaken souls from their
torpor; these the weapons that triumph over the world, however
criminal, careless, frivolous and hardened it may be.</p>

<blockquote><p>The rum vender's power is something enormous. We do not delude
ourselves into thinking that the fight for national prohibition will
be easily won. In many respects the liquor dealers will prove an
enemy harder to vanquish than the slave dealers were. For slavery
was an institution with a local habitation. It was restricted to
certain well-defined limits. The whole world knew where it was
and what it was doing. But rum is everywhere. Its upholders are
woven into the warp and woof of society in every city and hamlet.
It has a thousand heads, and it can hide them in times of danger
with wonderful facility. Slavery was bold, brazen and defiant.
It could be nothing else. But the liquor dealers, with equal bravado
and strength, are enabled to resort to the cunning and subtlety of
the serpent, when bravado is imprudent.</p>

<p>Then the liquor dealer's influence over his victims does not end
with control of the bodies. His slaves are his allies. He owns them,
many of them, body and soul for such a cause. They will fight for
rum and vote for rum as persistently as the saloonist himself. These
facts may as well be appreciated. When it comes to defiant antagonism,
when temperance men boldly array themselves in professed
opposition to the traffic in alcohol, the struggle will be severe. But
it is certain there will come no time in the future when it will be
less severe. The liquor power is <em>a rapidly growing power</em>. God
knows it is strong enough now, but it becomes stronger with each
passing day.</p>

<p>Are we willing that such a class of men not only hold such an
enormous power, but add to it indefinitely? In the census for 1880
the capital employed in the manufacture of liquor was over one
hundred and eighteen million of dollars, and the number of persons
employed in the manufactories and in saloons aggregated over one
hundred thousand. No nation can afford to leave such power in
the hands of such men. It is suicidal.</p>

<p>Having <em>said my say</em> about "Old Devil" and his "Clerks" I guess
I'll write a <em>little</em> letter to</p>

<p>
My Dear Sister:<br />
</p>

<p>Your good, kind letter was duly received. We sincerely thank
you. When meeting with savages who don't treat you respectfully
please ever remember that in M&mdash;&mdash; everybody who knows you
or about you loves you. Mrs. D. told me to write to Mrs. Wheaton
because "<em>she is a lovely Christian</em>."</p>

<p>"O taste and see that the Lord is good." Psa. 34:8.</p>

<p>That is the right way to find out that He is good. We may think
He is good, we may have some idea that He is so&mdash;but to know it,
and to know how very good the Lord is, we must taste his goodness.
He alone is good. He is goodness itself; and because He is
this, He wants us to taste, to enjoy Him.</p>

<p>Good men and women, and good children, will one day be like
the angels in heaven; and they begin to be such already in this
world. If it were not for them, if they were not here to be the
bearers of peace and happiness, the ministers of mercy and of love,
to wretchedness and woe, to the weary and the bowed down, how
wretched would this world be! A thousand blessings upon you,
beloved sisters, who, from the goodness of your great big heart,
endeavor to do good to others. It is through such holy and devoted
daughters of our thrice holy King and Father as Sister Elizabeth
that we taste and see how good the Lord is.</p>

<p>"You see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
own hand." Galatians 6:11. "I thank my God, making mention
of thee always in my prayers." Philemon, 4.</p>

<p>"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing
that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy
Ghost." Romans 15:13.</p>

<p>"Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and
them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."
Hebrews 13:3.</p>

<p>We salute thee, sister.</p>

Charlestown, Mass., Oct. 18, 1886.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton.
</p>

<p>Dear Sister&mdash;John 17:20, 21: "Everyone members one of another."
"If one suffer all suffer." I do not know that the relation
and consequent influence of member upon member can be better
illustrated than by the connection of the body, mind and spirit,
and the power that any one of the three has over the other two.</p>

<p>The mind depends upon the body to carry out its desires, and
the mind is in constant subjection to the body in health and in
sickness. The body is controlled by the mind as the ship is directed
in her course by the man at the helm. The spirit looks out through
the eyes of the body and is entranced with the scene of beauty, or
is crushed with the sorrow with which it is seized, according as we
look upon a thing of beauty or the eye rests upon things withered
and dead.</p>

<p>The life and experience of every man attest the fact that thought
and emotion, and the body in which the organs of thought and
feeling are placed, are inter-related in such a way and to such an
extent that the mind and body control, to a very great extent, the
activity of each other. The wise man, looking at the inner life and
the outer manifestation of it, from a little different point of view,
expresses it thus: "As a man thinketh in his heart so is he. The
spirit of a man will sustain his <em>infirmity</em>, but a wounded or broken
spirit who can bear?" Says a writer in the Laws of Health: "If
a man thinks he is an invalid he is one; if he thinks himself incompetent
he is incompetent, and so through the whole list." By
faith in Christ, as true and confiding as the trust of a child; by
boldness at the throne of grace; by firmness in resisting temptation,
and by resolution in the performance of every duty we are able
to maintain the connection we have formed with Christ, the head
of the body; to bear the fruit of the vine; to suffer with each
other; to be honored with the members of the body, and to rejoice
with those who rejoice.</p>

<p>As the connection of the body, mind, moral nature and spirit is
such as to give one part influence over the other parts and the
power to modify their health and action, so the relation which is
formed with the household of faith, when we come into Christ, is to
be honored by striving for the faith of the gospel and by an effort
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>

<p>If one in Christ now, this oneness can be maintained among
the brotherhood in but one way, and that is by being one with
Christ and God in purpose, plan and effort for the salvation of men
and by striving together for <em>the faith</em> of the gospel. The unity of
God's people cannot be maintained by erecting standards of our
own&mdash;by making our own opinions bonds of fellowship and tests of
soundness&mdash;by prescribing this and forbidding that. The unity is
to be maintained by striving together for <em>the faith</em> of the gospel.
The same thing is true with reference to the multitudes who are
following Christ as they have learned him. The unity of all these
distracted bodies is not to be brought about by any effort to form
a union, but by an effort on the part of each one to grow up into
Christ, the living Head; by all agreeing to disagree in their opinions;
and by all striving together for <em>the faith</em> of the gospel. This
lesson is to be taught the world by the disciples of Christ, and if
we do not teach the lesson aright, we may expect, and we ought to
receive the question: What do ye more than others?</p>

<p>When we are growing in favor with God and man; when we
are increasing in the knowledge of divine things; when our lives
are hid with Christ in God; when we are appropriating the spiritual
food which God has furnished; when we are proving to the world
that we have passed from death unto life; when we are loving each
other with pure hearts fervently; when we are continuing steadfast
in the apostles' doctrines and in the fellowship, in the breaking of
bread and in prayers, we are giving to the world and to professed
Christians everywhere a living demonstration that we are striving
together for the faith of the gospel.</p>

<p>"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good
tidings of good that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy
God reigneth!"</p>

<p>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be
in health, even as thy soul prospereth. III John 2.</p>

<h4>UNDER DEATH SENTENCE.</h4>

<p>In 1887, I found the writer of the following letters, with
nine other men, under sentence of death in the prison at
Ft. Smith, Arkansas. Before his cell door stood his wife
and four little children. They all seemed heart-broken and
I was deeply impressed with the sad, touching scene. After
talking with them and praying for them, I was led to believe
that the man was innocent of the crime for which he and
another young man had been condemned. The evidence
against them was purely circumstantial. The other man
was afterward given his liberty, but this one was held, as
many believed, for want of money to hire lawyers to properly
plead his case. I still believe him to be an innocent
man.</p>

<p>I left the state a short time before the day set for the execution,
but prayed the Lord to let his life be spared if he
was innocent. Some time after I learned that he, with several
others, had been given a life sentence in the Ohio penitentiary.
I went to the President and Attorney General in
Washington, D. C., several times, trying, if possible, to
secure his pardon. They were kind and courteous and after
looking up the evidence would have granted him a pardon
if the judge who had passed the sentence would request it,
but he refused to do so and finally died. Then all hope
seemed gone. The wife died of a broken heart. The children
all died and the dear old parents, broken-hearted, lingered
on, hoping against hope, until now they, too, may
have passed away. But the poor man lingered in prison,
with health, hope, friends, youth, all gone; forgotten by the
world, waiting for death to end his misery. I say hope
gone; I mean, hope for freedom here. His hope of heaven
proved an anchor to his sorrowing heart. He proved himself
a consistent Christian and a good, quiet, obedient prisoner.
A letter from Chaplain Starr, Columbus, Ohio, tells
me that he had been finally pardoned and was released January
4, 1904.</p>

Dear Sister in Christ:<br />
</p>

<p>Yours at hand. It found a small portion of us praying to God
for aid. We keep up our prayer meeting. There is but three of
us who attend regular. It is myself and Mr. M. and T. We want
to do all we can to save our souls. I am one who is to be executed
on the 19th and I am ready to go if God says for me to go. I
am sure to meet you in Heaven where there is no unjust court. I
want you to pray for me in good faith, for the prayers of the
righteous are powerful and I want you to remember the day I
am to die and pray for my soul to go to God where I can see
everlasting enjoyment.</p>

<p>I am sad, sister. It hurts my heart to think I have been a
good, affectionate man on earth and now I must die for the wicked
world or man's evil. I forgive all and will die an innocent man.
"God receive my soul" is my prayer.</p>

<p>Brother and sister B. came and prayed for us last week. Write
me again and I will give you all the news.</p>

<p class="center">
Yours truly,</p>

<p>I had to stop writing to get to prayer meeting and I tell you,
we had a good time. It does me good to get to say a word for
Jesus, in jail or out. I am as happy as anyone could be in prison,
I am sure. I am blessed with a sure love of God who can save
or destroy. We don't have preaching very often in here. There
are ten in here who are found guilty of murder. It is no wonder
people think they can't get justice. I am sure it is on account of
so many bad people being in the territory and around it.</p>

<p>I am thankful I am even spared to see a few more days and
to let me have more time to try for justice. I am doing all I
can and so are my friends and relatives. I have a good father and
mother to pray for me day and night and am sure there is many
a prayer gone to Jesus in my behalf.</p>

<p>Dear Sister in Christ:
</p>

<p>Yours at hand. It found me well and still pleading to God to
prepare my soul to meet my fate on the 19th of April. It is an
awful day for me to think of. I do hope and pray to God I won't
be put to death in such a cruel manner. I don't deserve such a
death, or any punishment at all for the accused crime. I don't fear
death, but I don't want to disgrace so many good people as it will
be a disgrace on all my relatives and me as clear of murder as
a child, and I don't believe God will allow me to be put to death
without a cause, but if God tells me to go on the scaffold I will
obey Him.</p>

<p>I had a dear brother come to see me this week, and when he left
me it just looked like it was the last sight of the dear brother,
although he said, "I will come to see you again before &mdash;&mdash;," then
he choked down and went away. He meant, "Before you are
executed." It would do my dear old parents an awful sight
of good to get a letter from you, stating what I said in regard to
a future home. I do wish you would write them.</p>

<p>We keep up our prayer meeting as regular as the time comes,
except we are hindered by a good cause. Seldom we miss our
meeting and prayers together. I am sorry to say there is only
three of us and I am all the doomed one of the three. I want
you when you are visiting prisons in Texas to inquire for a man
by the name of John H., as I have heard he was arrested in
Texas somewhere and was in jail. This is the same name as the
man we are accused of killing, and it may be the same man. I
wrote to Paris, Texas, but he was not there. If you find him let
me know at once. You can ask him if he ever knew Henry M. and
William W. He might deny us, so you can give me a description
and I can tell if it is him. Ask him of what nationality he is.</p>

<p>Your kind and welcome letter at hand. I hope you are being
blessed by our Almighty God. I am sure you are worthy of great
praise in well-doing. I am very sorry to inform you I am not
pardoned yet, but I thank God I have been respited till June 29.
It was thankful news for me and I am sure it is the power of our
God who wants justice done in everything here on earth. Oh,
what a great promise Jesus has promised us all if we will humble
ourselves and get low down at his feet! I am one that wants to
bow as low as I am required. I am a servant for Jesus as long
as I remain in this sinful world.</p>

<p>I am so glad my dear old pa wrote you. I don't get any
letters from him. I suppose he writes so pitiful to me the jailer
won't let me have his letters. I do not know any other cause. I
receive letters from my brothers and sisters regular. I thank you
for the letter father sent you. My misfortune is an awful burden
on their poor, old and feeble hearts, but I pray God to stay them
and help them to bear their sorrows and I am sure He will do so.</p>

<p>Mr. W., my partner, is granted a free pardon and the President
did not have time to investigate the evidence in my behalf, so he
respited me for further investigation. Several of the senators are
taking an anxious part for me and it is thought I will get a pardon.
I trust in God I will be set free and can be able to help catch
sinners for Jesus; I am sure I am willing.</p>

<p>I am sorry to inform you Brother M. was convicted of a brutal
murder as the evidence shows. I hope he is not guilty, but we
must not say.</p>

<p>It is a sad place here. Brother George B. and Brother T. have
gone back in the world. There is nothing done for Brother George
yet and his time is short.</p>

<p>The President refused to do anything for M., that one-armed
colored man, so he must meet his Jesus on the 19th of this month.
There is three more, but the President has not ruled on their cases
yet. I don't know whether they will be hung or not. I hope not.
God help them all.</p>

<p>Yours at hand. It found us all in good health, and for myself, I
am looking to Jesus. We still keep up our prayer meeting. It is
a great comfort for me to get to tell Jesus how I feel and to hear
the other brothers pray and talk for Him. Of course I know it is
hard for me and some others to bear this punishment, yet I feel
the kindness of our kind Saviour in my poor, sad heart. I only
ask God to save my life and I am willing to spend the rest of my
days in his service. I can only trust God that all will come out
right.</p>

<p>I will tell you of the dear ones who were hung on the 19th. It
was J. M. and A. Both were colored men. M. had the Catholic
priest pray for him and he said he was going to heaven. He was
very moody and pale; but he seemed to know his doom. Poor
fellow! God pity us all, for we have souls to save. A. joined the
Methodist church and was baptized the same day he was hung.
He was the bravest soldier I ever heard of. He smiled and said,
"Good-bye, Henry." I had to shed tears to see and feel the
nerves quivering when he and I both knew that it was death caused
the quivering of his pulse. Poor boys! They are better off than
I am, if they had made their peace with God.</p>

<p>Brother M. was convicted and is sentenced to be hung July 17.
There is five to be hung on that day. One colored man and one
Indian woman and one Indian man and F. C. and Brother M.
Myself and George B. got a respite. His is till June 21 and mine
till June 29. W. got a free pardon and I am held on the same
evidence. It is because I was poor and did not send a man to
plead for me at Washington, but people think I will come out
all right yet. I leave it all to God, who can do me justice without
money.</p>

<p>For the sake of each poor unfortunate soul you may chance to
meet, I ask God to be near you and show and tell you a word to
say to the poor condemned ones&mdash;a comforting word for their souls'
sake. Joy and peace be with you. You have my prayers, as weak
as they are. Jesus be with us all. Amen.</p>

complaining, but he is better now. We were blessed with Mr. and

comfort to us all. She was refused at first, but after she came
in and told us we sent her to Mr. C. and he told her to "sing and
pray for those men as much as she wanted to." It is queer for
a living being to not want the distressed to find relief, but it seems

I am sure there are some good hearts in here and God surely will
not allow them to be put to death. Yet it has been done, and it can be

<p>"May God be your helper and bless you," is my prayer continually.</p>

<p>I do not aim to impress on your mind that I am punished by
the prison laws, for I am not. I haven't had a bit of trouble with
any one since I came into this institution. I have to work hard
and I do more than I ought to, but I am afraid I won't please
my superiors in power over me. I put in many a sleepless night
from weariness of my daily labors. But I could not stand any
punishment, so I had better over-do myself than to be over-done.
My sorrow is now as much as I can bear. I am in need of all
good praying people's prayers, so I ask you and your friends to
pray for me.</p>

<p>I am honored with all the attire of a first-grade-prison man.
I have the red stripes you told me to get and my mustache. The
boys you know are well.</p>

<p>Dear Sister in Christ:
</p>

<p>Blessed be our God! He has saved us thus far and has given us
an ark to carry us over Jordan, safe to Eternity. We, as fallen
men, sometimes err in thinking we are not under God's protection,
but I say we are. Jesus came, not to bring saints, but sinners to
repentance. It is not the righteous that are called, but sinners.
There is only one way and that is by Jesus Christ, and that is to
humble ourselves to all that is right. Life has yet many opportunities
for serving God and his Church. Hitherto the Lord has
brought me and still in his loving hands I will cheerfully, hopefully
rest and trust till the shadows of earth shall be changed for
the sunlight of eternity, when my heavenly home is reached, to
be blessed forever with the Lord.</p>

<p>Sister, Brother M. says "God bless you," and you have his

all right as far as I know. They all say write to them. Bro. T.

<h4>SENTENCED FOR LIFE.</h4>

<p>Early in my prison work I found in one of our penitentiaries
a man sentenced for life who claimed to have acted
only with the motive of self-defense. That man is still confined
in prison, though he is one of the best of prisoners
and has given evidence of being a good, Christian man,
worthy of pardon. I wrote to the governor once in his
behalf, but too late to avail anything, as his term of office
was just expiring. While that poor man has been held
there, pardons have been granted to Chinamen, Spaniards
and other foreigners who were wicked and guilty, yet this
Christian man has been kept in confinement all these long
years, until there is only one other besides himself who is
now left of the prisoners who were there on my first visit.
The other has gone insane and I have feared that the one of
whom I write would lose his mind also. His article on the
need of prison reform entitled "Meditations of a Prisoner,"
found in another chapter, will, I believe, commend itself
to every fair-minded reader.</p>

<p>I give a few selections from his letters. I feel sure he
should be a free man. O the indifference of those who have
the power to free such worthy cases and will not! May God
give power to the faint and grace to the afflicted and let us
pray God to show the governors of our land to whom to
give pardon and freedom and from whom to withhold.</p>

<p>Your kind and welcome letter received and I was very glad to

<p>Dear Mrs. Wheaton:
</p>

<p>I have just received your welcome letter and was very glad
to hear from you, also to know that you were well. It is a wonder
you never get tired of traveling so much. When I think of how
you are constantly battling for the right in the interest of lost
sinners as we are it brings forth the thought in my mind&mdash;does
it pay? If one only looks at the general result he can but say&mdash;it
does not pay that one pure life should be worn out in the cause
when so few are made to see the error of their ways and turn to
the path of truth and right along the way of righteousness.</p>

<p>But again, if one life is truly brought into the light and a soul
saved, then we must admit it pays. And I know that your pilgrimage
of mercy brings forth good, for all who know you speak
kindly of you. Well, if a little spark of love is kindled in the heart
of the most hardened by the kindly deeds of another, who can
tell how great that spark may become? So let us not weary of
well doing but press on, hoping for the best and accepting the
worst in true Christian resignation.</p>

<p>I gave your message of love to all the men here. All were glad
to hear from you. O, my dear friend, I am so often troubled in
heart by the attitude of some people. Certainly I have been very
sinful. I have fully realized all that was wrong in my life. It
has been my endeavor to cast it all out of my life and to build on
a foundation of righteousness and faith in its place. I have been
blessed in my effort by the help of many who I feel have a personal
interest in me. At the same time no man has been more
inhumanly treated by those who profess to be Christians than I
have been and am.</p>

<p>Yes, my friend, we are commanded to pray for such people.
This I have done for nine years, but the persecution still goes
on. May God forgive them.</p>

<p>Now, a few words about the prison. Everything is changed
here. We have all new officers and guards, also another Governor.
The Chinese cook you spoke to was pardoned last January. I
was denied.</p>

<p>I am, with love, your sincere friend,</p>

all voted against me! So you see it is not the Governor alone
who is against me, but every one of them.</p>

<p>My dear friend, I don't think you would be able to do anything
for me. The Lord is strong certainly, but the ones who have my
freedom in their power leave the commands of the Lord out of
the question. Read the 18th chapter of Matthew, from the 21st
verse to the last of the chapter, and you will see what I mean.</p>

<h4>FAITHFUL INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF PRISON WALLS.</h4>

<p>Another case with which I was very much impressed in
the early days of my missionary work was that of a young
man of rare ability, gifted and sensible, who was spending
a term in one of our United States prisons. He was converted
and began working for God among the other prisoners.
After faithfully serving his time, he left the prison
with good prospects. He was taken into an office and did
exceedingly good service for the company, also for God and
souls,&mdash;his past being known only to his pastor, employers
and prison officials. After several years he married a most
estimable lady who was doing missionary work. They
prospered well. He was promoted from one position to another.
For nineteen years he has lived a devoted Christian.
All who know him honor and respect him. His wife has recently
passed over to the kingdom of heaven. He is still
living a true and noble life and he is only one of many
who have served time inside of prison walls, who are living
for God outside and for Heaven at last. I quote a few extracts
from letters received from him during the time of his
incarceration.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<blockquote><p class="head">
In Prison, January 12, 1885.</p>

<p>My Dear Friend:
</p>

<p>Your kind note was received and I was very much pleased to
hear from you, but was pained that you should think for a moment
that I was forgetting you. Since you left us we have had
several very earnest and interesting meetings&mdash;the fruit of your
presence and labor among us. Praise God, He can find his way
inside prison walls as well as outside. He is no respector of person.
Many men, not before confessing Christ or even anxious sinners,
have stood up manfully for prayers and may God give them grace
to accept and believe. It is very simple, my dear sister, is it not?
How I wish that all could see it! It only means total surrender
to Him, to give up the old longings and desires and trust Him
from day to day. Then comes the "perfect peace" which is
vouchsafed to them whose mind is stayed on God. Of course, you
will see us again. Our dear Chaplain and Warden are doing
everything possible for the spiritual welfare of all the men. The
Warden dignified our first meeting by giving us his personal religious
experience at the commencement of the service, and he is
willing and anxious to encourage in every way possible the religious
sentiment now prevailing. As for our Chaplain, I do not
believe there is his equal. I who am so closely associated with him
can truly testify to his untiring zeal in behalf of all of us. If
ever there was a living man, free from any selfish or worldly motives,
I believe it is he. The moral tone has been increasing ever
since he came among us. I shall not feel at all slighted if you
save your strength and time by not writing to me. Just send me
some little message by F. or any others (for I see them all
daily), and I shall be just as well pleased. It is not because I
do not like to have you write me, but I had rather spare you, or
help you.</p>

<p>If you will let me know the address of that dear lady at Raleigh
whom you stayed with, I will gladly make her something and
would like very much to make something for any other of the dear
friends who are good to you on your pilgrimage of love and mercy.
Shall not forget to make something for your brother. May God
bless and keep you and make his face to shine upon you for many
years yet to come, and may we finally meet in heaven where there
shall be no more parting and sorrow.</p>

<p>Your loving brother in Christ,</p>

<p>My Dear Friend:
</p>

<p>Do you think we have forgotten you? Why, no indeed! We
think and speak of you almost daily, but you are moving so that
we hardly know where to locate you. A day or two ago L., who is
my friend, got a postal card from you, and as he cannot write, by
permission just now and I have the privilege to do so, I drop these
few lines for him as well as for myself.</p>

<p>How glad we are to know the Lord has prospered your work.
How literally is the promise of Christ fulfilled, "Lo, I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the world." It seems so wonderful
that all people are opening their doors to Christian workers,
the doors which a few years ago were closed and to be opened
only through the power of God, who, as Daniel said, would "set
up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed," but it shall break
in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever.
Our Sabbath School is not in session this month but will renew its
course the first of September. We like our new Warden very well.
Our dear Chaplain is still with us and is quite well and engaged
as ever in his life work. His place would be very hard to fill
here. I have been reading this morning the 34th Psalm&mdash;"all my
fears," "all his troubles," "all his afflictions"&mdash;a deliverance
from all. "There is no want to them that fear Him." This
Psalm is full of comfort. Praise His name! We can find help
and comfort in any part of His holy Word. We all pray for
God's blessing upon you and your work and for the conversion
and salvation of all whom you minister unto. It does not seem too
great a thing to ask of the Lord. Both L. and F. send their love
to you and L. will write you soon. Also Mr. A. and Mr. R. and
many more send love and best wishes. I shall always consider you
my friend, and if in the Providence of God we shall never meet
in this world I hope to meet you with recognition in our eternal
and glorious home above.</p>

<p>My Dear Friend and Mother:
</p>

<p>Your letter received yesterday made me very happy. It was so
good of you to write so soon and send such a nice long letter, too.
I trust I am getting to value a letter from you as I ought, as I
realize more and more how your time is so zealously occupied and
needed. I have ever valued your letters for the help they gave
me, but I value them now for their scarcity. In the future, when
perhaps you may be no more, I shall esteem them among my most
valued treasures. Yet I may be called first! We know not the
hour, whether in youth, or old age, or in our prime when the angel
of death shall come to summon us to eternity. "Watch therefore,
be ye also ready," are words that I try to keep ever in mind, or
rather to keep my mind so stayed on Christ that moment by moment
He shall keep me saved so that I shall never need to whip myself
into keeping watch for my Lord. I am glad you believe in and
have the blood cleansing freedom from all sin. It is an experience
that meets with much opposition from worldly Christians and from
some whose good works follow them. These latter really enjoy the
experience, but are prejudiced at the name given to it by others.
I know that it meets with much opposition. The "Christian Witness"
comes to the prison every week. It is an exponent of holiness
and very interesting, as well as spiritual. I have a magazine
which contains a story of an ex-convict which would do some good
to those who think there is no hope or reform for such an individual.
I shall mail you the magazine, and if you can read it
do so and give it to others to read.</p>

<p>After a silence of several years my father has written me again.
You know he is living in C. and was formerly an instructor in
the State Prison at S. He is now old and broken in health, making
him incapable for steady work, so he is residing at a soldiers'
home. He expresses great anxiety in regard to my future, thinking
me friendless, etc. I have written him a long letter reviewing
the principal incidents of my prison life. How good God has
been to me and how my mind is at rest as regards the future because
I have left it in His hands. To find favor with my God is
all I desire. Having that, whatever my condition I shall be like
St. Paul, content. That is my view of a successful future or
life. Wealth, power, ability, all things that men aspire to in this
life, do not make or lead to success in my mind. Nothing but the
favor of God brings it to man, and that favor comes through the
"washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost."
Oh, I am so glad that I know this&mdash;even me! How can man doubt
the wondrous love of God when He is so patient to all who will
but look and see. Well, said someone, that they do not want to
look and see lest they should be healed and be saved. My poor old
father is a church-member, but I fear he knows nothing about
Holy Ghost religion, Jesus Christ's religion, pure and undefiled. I
want to do just right all of the time. I know my heart is right
because I hate sin and love righteousness. If the Lord has no
other work for me when I leave here, I would like to labor under
your guidance. When are you coming this way again? I would love
to greet you once more before I die.</p>

<h3>Letters from Co-workers, and Some of My Prison Girls.</h3>


<p>In speaking of prisoners or of those within prison walls
many think only of men being found there. This is due
doubtless to the few women compared to the number of men
found in these places. In my efforts to do good to all, I
have been especially mindful of those of my own sex, and
have ever endeavored to encourage and lift up my sisters
who have fallen victims to sin and misfortune. I give in
this chapter a few letters from sisters who are directly interested
in the care and work for the prison bound; also
extracts from letters from a number of my prison girls.
The co-operation in my work and the kindness and hospitality
ever shown me by the sisters, matrons, wives of officers,
etc., are especially appreciated, and all these dear ones
are often remembered at the throne of divine grace. These
too shall all share in the fruit of the toil and labor in the
final reckoning. Neither will my girls whom I have tried to
help, that have shown their appreciation and have tried to
serve the Lord, be forgotten.</p>

<p>Women who are the victims of sin and are condemned by
society and the law, have as much right to be restored and
encouraged when they amend their ways, as have men. The
following letters are, I believe, sufficiently explanatory in
themselves, and may be read with interest.</p>

My Dear Mrs. Wheaton:
</p>

<p>Your letter to one of our boys was handed to me by him today.
I enjoyed reading it, and want to write you at once. I think
V. was very seriously impressed by your service here, although I
have not yet had an opportunity to talk with him as I have wanted
to. He was sick yesterday and not in school. Tomorrow I hope
to see him again. I am so glad that you had the opportunity of
seeing his parents. I know they will be greatly benefited spiritually
by your visit. I am sure our blessed Lord leads you, as you carry
peace and comfort wherever you go. Dear Mother, you comforted
me. I was impressed, as I have never been before, by the <em>power
of prayer</em>, and I know your prayers are heard and answered.
This text came to me <em>over and over</em> while you were here, "The
effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." I
felt instinctively that your prayers could help me. Oh, my friends!
I <em>appeal</em> to you to pray for me. I may be here only until April,
but if God has work here which He wishes <em>me</em> to do, I know He
will order it that I shall stay longer. But I do want to be <em>filled</em>
with His Holy Spirit, that while I stay I may do <em>everything</em> that
is possible to warn and encourage these poor fallen brothers to
seek a Savior's love and forgiveness. I <em>want</em> a power which I feel
<em>might</em> be mine, but it has not yet come. I want to reach the boys
and tell them of Christ's love, but I have not the power of speech.
I cannot convince them that <em>my</em> Savior is their Savior too. So
often they say to me, "Well, I guess that kind of a life is the
best kind to lead after all, but I never will make a start in a
place of this kind."</p>

<p>The next day after you left one boy said to me that he had never
before heard a talk that had impressed him as he was impressed
Tuesday. I believe he is seriously awakened. I think <em>three</em> others
are, also, beside the one of whom I told you the day you left.
I think V. is one.</p>

<p>There is a boy here who says he heard you in Kansas City eight
or nine years ago. He was not at service, but saw and recognized
you. He thought you would know him if you saw him.</p>

stay, although we felt it was for the best. When she reached
Algona she was too sick to go into the country five miles where
she was going to stay. Tuesday morning she was taken out, and
Thursday afternoon died with La Grippe or Pneumonia. Several of
the women here have had La Grippe. All seem to be improving, as
I insist upon their taking excellent care of themselves.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Wheaton, I hope you will write to Anna, also a letter
to all the girls that I can read to them. They will be glad to
think you have not forgotten them. Trusting that you are in
good health and that you see good results from your labors, I
remain your friend,</p>

<p>Your card was received in due time. All glad to hear from you.
The quarantine is still on at the prison. No news there. No
visitors allowed. No baskets sent in, only money. Mr. Cook has
not missed a day at work since last winter. He was off twelve
days to visit his dear mother. She will soon pass to the other
side. Your card was filled with sadness. Be cheerful and rejoice,
for soon you will go to glory to praise Him forevermore. I will
write some to Sister Kelley. Write me a long letter. Chaplain
P. has been on the sick list. Everything going on nicely. Never
had a better warden than now in the last eighteen years that I
have known this prison. Hoping to hear of your good health, I am

<p>I am glad to learn that you are about to embody your experiences
as a missionary to the inmates of the prisons and penitentiaries of
the various states in which you have labored in the name of the
Master. It has been no easy work. It has demanded much faith,
hope and charity on your part. You have gone with untiring zeal to
those who are despised and forsaken on account of their criminal
acts.</p>

<p>In the spirit of our blessed Lord and in obedience to His command
you have gone year after year to the habitations of disgrace
and sorrow and carried the cheering and helpful promises and the
forgiving mercy of our dear Savior.</p>

<p>You will have a rich reward from our Heavenly Father. I am
sure your words of gospel truth and your songs of praise have
often touched the hearts of the female prisoners under my care.
The most rebellious and hardened have felt and testified to the
gracious power of the gospel of love as you have uttered it here.
My hope and my prayer is that the Almighty Shepherd may guide,
keep and sustain you in this noble work of your life.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Wheaton:
</p>

<p>I will try and answer your kind and welcome letter which came
to hand a few days ago. We were all very glad to hear from you.
Our dear sister, Mrs. Jones, is dead. The dear old lady who
was up to the workhouse with you when you were here. She was
a dear friend to all the girls here, but she has gone home. She
can come to us no more, but we can go to her. The last words
she said when she was here was good-bye, and that she would meet
us all in heaven. We have very nice meetings now and would like
to have you with us. We pray for you every day and we want
you to pray for us that we may see the right way and that we
may go out of here with light hearts and go about doing good.</p>

<p>We had a nice Christmas. Our Warden treated us with turkey,
and we were all so glad that he was so kind to us.</p>

<p>Well, we will begin a new year tomorrow, and I hope we will
lead a different life, a better life, for if we believe in Jesus He
will save us; yes, He will keep us through the dark valley. He
will go with us to the end, as He has promised, if we will put
our trust in Him. I have gained a great victory since you were
here. I have forgiven an enemy that I thought I never could
forgive.</p>

<p>Well, I will close by sending you my love, and as I have only
one sheet of paper my friend will send this on to you. I remain,</p>

<p>My Dear Mother:
</p>

<p>I wish I could tell you how much joy and happiness your letter
gave me. It came just at the time when I needed it most. I am
sick and feeble, suffering with spine and lung trouble, have not
been able to work for the last three weeks. Can go to my meals
and wait upon myself, and I have my Jesus with me. Oh, how
He comforts and helps make the rough places smooth, and in the
lonely hours of the night when the pain is almost beyond endurance,
I think of my Savior and what He suffered without sin, and of what
a weak coward I am to complain.</p>

<p>Mother, we are some of us so impatient when we have pain, and
I am afraid I am one of those. Please pray for me that I may
bear mine with Christian fortitude.</p>

<p>I hope it may please God to let me live to get out of this place
and have a home for myself and baby, and if my dear Mother
Wheaton would come and see me and rest herself for a few weeks,
would it not be nice? Mother, I am a widow with one child and
some means, but not much. Still I intend to use some of my money,
when I have control of it, to do good to others. I have suffered,
God has opened my eyes and showed me my sins and selfishness of
former years, and I thank Him for sparing me to see it in this
light.</p>

<p>Many of the girls that were here when you last visited us have
gone out and a good many are going out this year. Pray for
them. I pray for you every night. God bless and keep you is the

<p>Your very welcome and unexpected letter received. It is impossible
to tell you with what joy and heartfelt gladness we all
gathered together to hear it read. You do not know how often
your children speak together of you, of where you are and what
you are doing and what keeps you so long away from your Western
flock. It was so long since last we heard from you that we are
beginning to think our Heavenly Father had need of you and
had taken you home, but all praise to His name. He has spared
you to send us another loving, encouraging message, which we
promptly answer in love and sympathy, each one giving a word,
although only three different handwritings will be seen. Remember
when reading the words that twenty-five of your lone children are
here represented in your letter.</p>

<p>You speak of wishing for your prison children when you were
sick. O, how gladly many of us would minister to your wants,
to be under the influence of your kind and loving advice, following
in your footsteps of love and life as it is in Christ Jesus our
Lord and Master. But though we are separated by so many miles,
thanks be to the Almighty we can feel the influence of your continued
prayers, and many of us are greatly encouraged to keep
on striving, knowing that the crowning day will come by and by.</p>

<p>Each one says: "Ask Mother Wheaton when she is coming."
Do not be too long in coming, for some of your dear ones are
leaving every month during the spring, and we are anxious to
receive your blessing before entering the cold, heartless world of
sin and sorrow. Yet some of us will take Jesus with us, and in
His name begin life again. Pray for us all that our hearts may
be fully and entirely given over to God, with our hands in His
hand, be led to the mercy-seat. Yes, dear Mother, we shall, with
God's help, "strive to enter in at the straight gate."</p>

I was just thinking today, O, how happy you will be in the end
when Jesus shall say unto you: "Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you." And O, dear Mother, He
will say to you: "I was in prison and ye visited me." I am still

<p>O if I was only free, the greatest pleasure of my life would

heart. I have never had any one to be kind to me; I have known
nothing but sorrow all my life. My past is almost a blank. Dear,
kind sister, look on me with pity&mdash;a friendless, motherless girl.
I am alone in the world. I was drawn into this place through
cruel treatment. I have no money, and I am helpless. If God
does not have mercy on me, I do not know what will become of me.
If I had only a good, kind friend like you to guide me through
life, I would have been a far better woman than I am. If God
will save me I shall live in the future a life of honor and work
for God.</p>

<p>Pray for me. Tell me in what way I am going to help myself.
O sister, I am so troubled; sometimes I think I will end my
miserable existence. But I know if I should take my own life that
it would be a terrible sin; but how can I help thinking such things
in a place like this? No friends, no home, and no money; sick

your kind letter and cannot help writing to you. I cannot write
very good, so please excuse mistakes. Your letter found all the
girls well. I have often thought of you and wished that I could
be a Christian like you; but I am a poor sinner and have been
all my life. I never heard one word out of the Bible in my life

I am a deep sinner, but I want to do better. My conscience
tells me that I must try to be a better woman. I have been a
very bad girl, but I think my Savior will forgive me, if I repent
in time. Sometimes I nearly go crazy just thinking what a life
I have led. O if I would die now what would become of me? I
want you to pray for me, mother, for I do believe you can help
me by praying for me.</p>

<p>I have not long in here now. My time expires on the 25th day of

life. My soul is tired. O, I am so wicked! I have tried to pray
the best I knew and I got scared. Something seemed to bother me,
and I was afraid to go to sleep. Mother, why do I get scared?
Is it because I have sinned so much? But I will try again and
again. I am willing to do right and live an honest life, and I
will or die in the attempt. I have had a lot of trouble in my life
and it drove me to all my downfalls, but I can see that I am sending
my soul to everlasting torment, so I want to turn now and seek
for the Lord. Tell me how I can, mother.</p>

<p class="head">
Southern Illinois Penitentiary,<br />
Menard, Ill., Nov. 27, 1902.</p>
<p>Dear Mother:<br />
</p>

<p>We are writing you from within these dark grim walls. Although
we are condemned as the outcasts of society and separated from
friends and loved ones and continually laboring under great mental
strain and worry, still there is no pain or sorrow great enough to
destroy our happiness in our thoughts of you. Your love and
thoughtfulness for us and our spiritual welfare is a priceless jewel
that all the wealth of the world cannot buy nor sorrow rob us of.
No, never. Although the world has condemned and despised us,
but we know that there is one&mdash;if only one&mdash;that loves even the
outcasts.</p>

<p>Several of your boys have gone from here since you were among
us. Some have crossed to the beyond; others to blessed freedom.
Still a greater number are left here with fondest recollections of all
you have done for us, which is one of the greatest among our causes
for thanksgiving. It is hardly necessary to say, Remember us. We
all remain your sons until death.</p>

<p>An extract from a report of the Chaplain of the Southern
Illinois Penitentiary will be of interest:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Chester, Ill.</p>

<p>To the Honorable Board of Commissioners,</p>
<p class="left10">Chester, Ill.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:
</p>

<p>I take pleasure in making a report of my first year's work as
Chaplain.</p>

<p>The regular chapel services have been held every Sunday at 9:40
a. m. The chapel has been well filled at all regular services and
crowded on special occasions. The attendance at religious services
is voluntary, but most prisoners consider it a privilege to attend.</p>

<p>The words of encouragement I have received from prisoners in
conversation and by letter make me feel that good is being accomplished.
More than one hundred men have given me their names as
Christians or seekers of religion.</p>

<p>I attend all calls made by the prisoners during the week and visit
one cell house each Sunday evening.</p>

<p>My visits are so planned that I see each prisoner in his cell at
least twice a month and give him a chance to make his requests
known.</p>

<p>The men have been urged to study the Bible and have been furnished
tracts and other helps in Bible study. I have been astonished
in making my rounds to find so many men reading the Bible.
One hundred and fifty new Bibles have been purchased during the
year. Six hundred Sunday-school quarterlies have been furnished the
prisoners each quarter during the year and they have been urged
to keep in touch with the outside world by studying these lessons.
The Sunday-school lesson is read every Sunday as a scripture lesson
and comments are made upon it.</p>

<p>The sick in the hospital and the shut-in prisoners in the cell
houses are visited daily and are supplied with books and papers.
Some of them read a book each day.</p>

<p>The Murphy Temperance Pledge has been furnished and more than
five hundred prisoners have signed the pledge. If the saloons could
be closed out poor-houses, jails and prisons would soon be almost
empty.</p>

<h4>SUICIDE OF A PRISONER.</h4>

<p>While on my way to the State Prison at Chester, Illinois,
in the year 1888 (if I remember rightly) I was especially
impressed by the sad appearance of a fellow-passenger, a
mother, accompanied by three children. I was sure that
she was in deep trouble. I said to my helper, "Mary, that
woman is going to the Penitentiary." She said, "How do
you know?" I answered. "I feel sure of it and I will convince
you that I am right."</p>

<p>Having entered into conversation with the woman, I assisted
her as I found opportunity in caring for her children.
When I asked her where she was going, she said, "I am going
to Chester." I said, "I, too, am going to Chester and
will gladly assist you in getting off with the children."</p>

<p>At the station we parted, but the next morning, which
was the Sabbath, as I passed through the guard-room of the
State Prison I saw this woman talking to her husband, who
was a prisoner. She sat beside him and he was holding one
of the children and she had another in her arms. The third
was playing near by. All were too young to know of the
sorrow that had come to their home, or the shame that had
fallen upon them. They were with papa and mamma and
felt safe and happy. Alas! how little they knew how soon
they were to be left fatherless!</p>

<p>I passed on and was busy during the entire day for I
had the liberty of the prison and the privilege of working
among the prisoners. So busy was I that for the time being
I had lost sight of that poor wife and mother, but only
the next morning the Chaplain called for me and said, "Sister
Wheaton, I have oh, such a sad task before me this
morning! I wish you would do it for me." I said, "Chaplain,
I will try. I am willing to do anything that I can to
help you." And then he said, "Do you remember the man
and woman you saw yesterday in the guard-room talking?"
I said, "Yes; I remember them well; I met the woman on
the train on my way here." He replied, "Well, that man
was so heart-broken at the thought of parting with his wife
and children that he asked her to promise him that if he
should die in the prison she would have him brought home
for burial. She promised him she would do so and last
night that poor man committed suicide in his cell and now
someone must go and tell that woman of her husband's
death." I said, "Chaplain, that is a hard thing to do, but I
will try." He said, "I wish you would,&mdash;being a woman
you can comfort her better than I could." Well, I went
along the hall until I came to the door of the room she occupied,
for, she too, as well as myself, was a guest of the
kind warden's wife. I opened the door softly and looked
in. In memory I can see her yet as she sat with one child
in her lap while the other two little ones were playing
around her knee. She was softly singing some old country
tune. As I looked my heart failed me. I turned away in
sorrow and returned to the Chaplain and said, "Chaplain, I
cannot do it. I cannot break that poor woman's heart. I
just can't tell her," and he said, "Then I will have to do it.
Someone must tell her," and so he broke the message as
best he could. Never will I forget the anguish of that poor
woman's heart as she wept out her grief and suffering! I
tried to comfort her as best I could. I took the same train
with her as she started for home with her husband's body
in the baggage coach ahead. As best I could I ministered
to her and those poor helpless children as long as our journey
carried us over the same road and when I changed
cars I tried to utter some words of comfort, but oh, friends,
what could I say, what could I do? Only the sympathy of
the loving Savior could reach her case and I left her, never
to meet her again on this side, but oh, may we not hope that
in some way God found a way to have mercy upon that
poor, misjudged man and that those loved ones may meet
again where no mistakes will be made by judge or jury?
For many believed that poor man to be innocent of the
crime with which he was charged. If I remember rightly a
barn had been burned and he had been accused of setting
it on fire and had been convicted through purely circumstantial
evidence. Brokenhearted over his disgrace and the
thought of again being separated from wife and children,
the poor man made a rope of the bed-clothing in his cell
and used it to take his own life.</p>


<h4>"I HAVE NO FRIENDS."</h4>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1903, I was in the Ohio Penitentiary
at Columbus. Officers and chaplain were kind, as usual.
After holding services in the hospital, I held service with
the men under death sentence; then went to the prison-yard
where all the others were having a holiday. There the
Chaplain assisted Sister Taylor and myself to hold services
in the open air. Many seemed glad to get the message of
love in song and prayer and preaching and many came to
shake hands with us, while singing the closing hymn.</p>

<p>One poor old man, a foreigner, handed me a little package
about as large as a walnut. The paper was soiled from
contact with his hand that warm day. The poor man in
tears said, "Good-bye," and I forgot all about the little
package till on the train that night going east, where I
found it in my pocket and found inside a silk handkerchief
and a 25 cent silver piece. On the paper was written his
name and number and these words, "I have no friends."
I wept over that small token of love as I do not often weep
over a gift. I have that little handkerchief safe. It seems
sacred to me. How I felt repaid for my hard day's toil.</p>

<p>That night while I was holding services on the train the
conductor said, "Mother, I don't see how you stand so much
hardship;" I said, "Conductor, I had even forgotten that I
had had neither dinner or supper today."</p>

<p>I think I know something of what Jesus meant when He
said to His disciples after ministering to a needy soul, "I
have meat to eat that ye know not of."</p>

<p>Chaplain Starr in one of the following letters refers to the
open air service on July 4th; also to some of the men under
death sentence with whom I had labored. The Indian
woman to whose death and burial he refers is the same
one who is mentioned in the letters of W. H. M. in another
place.</p>

<p>My Dear Sister: Your letter received this morning was a very
pleasant surprise. We have now an additional man in the Annex.
There are three men sentenced to electrocution in September and
October. What change may come we do not know. I gave them your
letter; they will read it over by themselves, and the tracts also.
They still say that your visit with them on the Fourth of July did
them much good. I have also delivered your letter to D., and with
it a letter from myself, giving him encouragement and offering
to render him any friendly assistance. The old Indian woman,
Elsie J., whom I think you have several times seen in the female
prison, died on the 9th, and we gave her a Christian burial yesterday.
She was converted and baptized some time ago. I am glad
that you are preserved and sustained in your great work as prison
evangelist. If D., and N., and W. write to you I will forward the
letters to your address. With kind wishes and regards, I am,</p>

<p>Dear Sister: Your recent postal came duly to hand. I received
your letter in July from the South and wrote you a reply, but have
kept it until the present time, not knowing where to mail it so it
would reach you. I will now send it in this letter, so that you will
see that I have not forgotten you and answered your letter at the
time. You inquire concerning the men in the Annex; we have now
six men in the Annex. One of them has been granted a new trial
and some others are expecting to get new trials. They do not take
any great interest in religion, but yet they read the Bible some and
talk about it. I will tell them of your interest in them and assure

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton.

<p>Dear Sister: I have just received your letter from Washington,
D. C., inquiring about the men in our prison death cell.</p>

<p>There are ten there now and two have been taken out for new
trials. If these are sent back we shall have twelve. The largest
number, until this list, ever in the Annex was nine.</p>

<p>Murders, as well as other crimes of violence to person and property,
are on the increase and society is trying to protect its life&mdash;without
much security, so far.</p>

<p>Perhaps three of the men are Scripturally penitent, three others
interested and four indifferent to religion&mdash;so far as we can see.
The men have Bibles, religious song books and papers, library books
and religious letters from relatives. They are not allowed to correspond
without especially good reasons for permits to do so. I hold
a little meeting and Bible study with those who care for it almost
daily at 2 p. m., at which time you might help us with your prayers.</p>

<p>Sentiment is not salvation. The trouble, both in the prison and
out of it, is, men will not seek after God. Yes, I am busy and
ought to be busy about my Master's business, and so are you.</p>

<h4>WAY OPENED IN ANSWER TO PRAYER.</h4>

<p>I had for many years prayed for an opportunity to
preach in one of the largest state prisons. Again and again
I had been refused by both the warden and chaplain. But
at last through a new governor of the state I was permitted
to enter this prison for religious services.</p>

<p>Calling at the office of the governor and asking permission
to go to the prison and assist in the services, he said,
"Certainly, we shall be glad to have you. There will be no
difficulty, as we have new officers. You can preach in the
prison." Before I had left the Governor's private office the
warden of the prison being present spoke and said, "Certainly,
they would be very glad to have you take part with
them." I asked if I should not see the chaplain, but the
warden said he would be all right, and be pleased. But I
insisted that it was only courtesy to see the chaplain. And
asking the governor to please write a note to him, he did so
and remarked that the state carriage was waiting at the
door and I should be driven to the chaplain's house.</p>

<p>Arriving at his home I was met by his little daughter who
carried my card to her father and he soon came into the
room asking what I wanted. "I should like, if you please,
to take part with you in the services at the prison chapel
tomorrow (Sunday) as I have been some years in prison
work," I replied. "No indeed," he answered, "I cannot allow
a woman to speak in my meetings. I will never permit
any woman to take my pulpit." I made no reply, but
that the state carriage was waiting for me and I must go,
but said to him, "Here is a letter from the governor. Will
you kindly look at it before I leave?" He took the message
and noting its contents he changed color and seemed confused;
saying, "I never did allow a woman to speak in my
meetings. But seeing the governor's request and your
years of experience, I will allow you to come in the morning
and conduct the women's meetings." The governor's letter
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Executive Department, Oct. 24, 1891.</p>

<p>Dr. O. W. G.,</p>
<p class="left5">Chaplain of Penitentiary.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
</p>

<p>The bearer, Mrs. E. R. Wheaton, is a prison evangelist of national
reputation and experience, who brings letters of strong recommendation
from wardens of the prisons she has visited, and I commend
her to your kind consideration. She has expressed a willingness, if
not a desire, to participate in your services tomorrow afternoon in
the chapel and I trust you will afford her every facility for so doing.</p>

<h4>A WOMAN CONVERTED AND HEALED.</h4>

<p>I went praying for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
While I was speaking I was impressed to step down the
aisle and lay my hand upon the head of a vicious looking
colored woman. I afterward learned that she was a life
time prisoner and a very dangerous woman. Instantly the
power of God fell upon her and she was wonderfully converted
then and there, and to the best of my knowledge is
still true to God. The other women seeing this, their leader
in sin (for so she was) so changed, were subdued and convicted
of their sins. The meeting closed with victory for
God. The chaplain was convinced and said, "You have
won the worst woman in the prison. You have the hearts
of all the prisoners now, for her influence is great. You
come and preach to the men this afternoon. I am convinced."
Years have come and gone. Governors, wardens
and chaplains have been changed; but God does not change,
and the doors of that prison are still open to me, and God
always blesses every service.</p>

<p>Some years later upon visiting this prison again we found
this poor colored woman much afflicted and walking on
crutches. The sister with me and I prayed for her, and
she was instantly healed, throwing her crutches aside at
once. The matron then gave her the key to go down and
unlock the outside door for us, having so much confidence
in her. She received a pardon from the governor later.</p>

<p>Another woman in the same prison was also prayed for
and was instantly healed by the Lord, of a large tumor,
and ran and praised God for what He had done for her.</p>


<h4>A CHANGE WROUGHT.</h4>

<p>For some years another prison was closed to me. Why, I
never knew. I prayed that the doors of that prison might
be opened to me. When the Lord sent me back there I
found such a change as I had never before witnessed in the
same length of time. There was a good Christian chaplain,
one of the best of wardens, and good deputies. Every prisoner
was in an improved state of mind and morals, and all
in harmony and glad to obey the rules of the prison. I was
treated with courtesy and kindness, and was given all the
time in the services, and was entertained. When I left I
was conveyed to the depot with ladies as escorts, and a
"trusty" as driver. Such are the wonderful workings of
God through faith and prayer. The meetings in this state
prison were owned and blessed of the Lord. The Holy
Spirit led and all seemed to enjoy and appreciate them. The
chaplain said, "How much good was accomplished!" All
were united in harmony and God was glorified.</p>


<h4>A CHAPLAIN IN MY AUDIENCE.</h4>

<p>At another time, arriving at a certain city where there
was a state's prison, I met in the depot a young lady wearing
a Salvation Army bonnet. She was crying at not being
met by friends as she had expected, and I asked her to
go with me. She gladly did so and I proceeded to the
prison to ask permission to hold services for the prisoners
on the next day which would be the Sabbath. Obtaining
the consent of the chaplain I waited till the time for the
service on Sabbath morning and returned. The guard refusing
to admit me, I sent for the chaplain. When he
came he also refused me, saying he could not permit me to
hold the service, as he thought I belonged to the Salvation
Army. A friend suggested that I should go to the Governor
at his residence, saying that he was a kind man. I did
so, and was very kindly received. Having listened to my
request he said, "Yes, you may have your meeting in the
prison,"&mdash;he having heard of my work before. He wrote
a card for me to carry with me, and I took it and returned
to the prison. The preacher and the Sisters of Charity had
all gone to the women's department. The men were out in
the large yard. I called, "Boys, come on, we are going to
have a meeting." How they hurried pell mell to the chapel!
And such a meeting! The power of God fell. Just then
the chaplain entered, much surprised of course, and I said,
"Chaplain, I am permitted through the kindness of the Governor
to hold this service. Will you please be seated?"
Had a most glorious meeting, closing with results altogether
satisfactory to the chaplain.</p>


<h4>IMPRESSED TO TARRY.</h4>

<p>While holding a meeting in a certain city, I was impressed
day after day to tarry. I did not know why. I wanted to
go, but still the Lord impressed me to wait. One evening
a cry was heard, "A man is shot." Immediately the Spirit
impressed me, "That is what I detained you here for." I
rushed out into the night, and inquired where the man had
been carried. They told me to the hotel. I went immediately,
got admittance to his room and found him in a dying
condition, with no one that knew God to pray for him.
And there by the bedside of the dying man, some mother's
boy,&mdash;dying without God and without hope in the world,&mdash;I
tried to point him to the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sin of the world, hoping that the Lord would give him
a chance at the eleventh hour to seek salvation, and I believe
God heard my prayer for this soul.</p>


<h4>ENCOURAGEMENT BY THE WAY.</h4>

<p>In the Pacific Garden Mission in Chicago one night, after
addressing the audience and singing the Gospel to the people,
I gave an invitation to all who desired to lead a new
life and serve the Lord to come forward and publicly confess
Christ and repent of their sins. Instantly a fine looking
young man rose in the rear of the hall, hurried to the front
and grasped my hand, saying that he saw me three weeks
before in the Deer Lodge, Montana, State Prison. He said
that three days before, he was released and had come to
Chicago, and passing along the street he heard me singing
a favorite hymn at the open air meeting before services in
the hall, and was attracted in. With hand raised, he
promised to be a Christian and live for God and meet me in
Heaven. He said he had my Bible that I gave to the matron
of the prison, who, when he was leaving, gave it to him.
"Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after
many days." Many others gave themselves to the Lord that
night but this was one of my prison boys, and I was his
mother, in that sense, as my life has been consecrated to God
for that special line of work.</p>

<p>The day following, on my way east, I was compelled to
stay over night at a way station where we were to change
cars. As I left the train I heard, as usual, the call of cab-men
but passed on into the waiting room. Several followed
me, but one took me by the hand and addressing me familiarly
said, "Get into my cab, mother, it is all right; I'll
take you where you wish to go." Mother Prindle, who was
with me said, "Do you know Mother Wheaton?" He replied,
"I have read about her," but the look in his kind eyes
told me it was one of my boys from prison. He was now
settled in life, a good man, with a wife and two children.
He escorted us to the jail where I desired to hold services,
then to the home of a minister, and from there to our lodging
house.</p>

<p>I bless God, and will through all eternity, that the dear
Lord ever called me to work in the prisons as well as in
other lines of Christian work. There are many all over this
land now serving God, leading good, honest lives, a blessing
to their country and an honor to God's cause, who were
found in prisons and slums, discouraged and having given
up all hope of ever being anything but miserable and
wretched. They are now serving the blessed Christ who
came to seek and to save that which was lost, and destroy
the works of the devil, not willing that any should perish,
but rather that all should be saved. O reader, many are
the lives we might rescue from the ranks of the enemy if
we were more in earnest and lived in close touch with God,
and more under the power and inspiration of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p>Once in a meeting I was attending, the minister in charge
took another young preacher by the hand, and said: "I
want you to preach for us." The one addressed came to
the front of the platform and said: "Yes, I will; but first
I want to say I was once in an insane prison, an awful
place. No one will ever know all we had to suffer there.
I was insane through drink&mdash;no one could help me. I was
sin-hardened and hard-hearted, but this Mother (pointing
to myself) came to our criminal prison and sang and
prayed and talked to us, and was kind to us, and my heart
was melted, and I wept&mdash;something I could not, would not
do until then. Her kindness won me, and I was saved,
truly sanctified, and I have been preaching the Gospel for
four years."</p>


<h4>A CASE OF CRUEL NEGLECT.</h4>

<p>At the best, life in prison is hard. How much worse when
cruelty and neglect are added to the necessary restrictions
that are placed upon those in confinement. I knew of one
young colored man in prison in the south who was compelled
to endure the winter weather without proper clothing or
covering. His one blanket was so short that his feet were
so badly frozen they had to be amputated. Think you that
such things as these do not cry to God for vengeance?</p>


<h4>ANOTHER SUICIDE.</h4>

<p>Well do I remember a promising young man, who, when
I was preaching in a prison in a southern state, began
trembling and ran back into his cell and called for an officer
to bring me to him. I found that he was quite weak from
a bullet wound he had received in a drunken row in a saloon,
he having killed a man in the fight. He was a young
man with bright prospects before him, but bad company
and a love for strong drink had wrought his ruin. He told
me of his uncle who was a minister, a prominent evangelist.
I was much surprised that a nephew of so popular a minister
should be in state's prison for such an awful crime,
crushed with shame and remorse. Could it be possible?
His mother was a rich lady.</p>

<p>This young man either because of his wealth and position,
or because of his good conduct in prison, or both, was
given privileges and often sent outside the prison grounds.
Often I plead with him to come to Christ. But one day the
old demon of drink had overcome him and having secretly
obtained some liquor, while at a game of cards he shot
himself. Let us throw the mantle of charity over that
blighted life, and leave him in the hands of a just God.
Who will be willing to answer at the bar of God for that
soul? "Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, that
puttest thy bottle to him and makest him drunken also."&mdash;Hab.
2:15. "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the
Lord."</p>


<h4>JUST OUT OF PRISON.</h4>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"O the wrongs that we may righten,</span>
<span class="i0">O the skies that we may brighten,</span>
<span class="i0">O the hearts that we may lighten&mdash;</span>
<span class="i4">Helping just a little!"</span>
</div>

<p>While traveling on the train one day, the brakeman said
to me: "There is an ex-convict in the smoking-car." "All
right, I will go in and see him," I said. I went and took
him by the hand as he sat alone in the rear seat of the
car, sad and dejected, with no money, no friends, no home.
His mother had died while he was incarcerated in prison;
home broken up, nowhere to go. How glad I was to take
this poor soul upon my heart, and intercede for him in silent
prayer; and then have him come into the other coach and
share my lunch. At parting he promised me he would live
a temperate life, and serve God the best he knew. I believe
the dear Lord had me travel on that train to meet that poor
unfortunate and help and strengthen his faith in Christianity,
by showing him attention outside as well as inside
the prison walls. How often a soul is saved from a downfall
by a word in season; a kind hand-clasp, a "God bless
you; cheer up, look up, better days are coming," etc. When
hope is well-nigh gone, and friends have forsaken, and all
has failed; yet we can always tell such that "God never
fails."</p>


<h4>DYING IN PRISON.</h4>

<p>One day as I was alone in a gloomy prison a poor boy
called to me and said, "Write to my mother, but don't tell
her where you found me. Please don't tell her, for it would
kill her. She never could live and know her boy was in
prison." On the dirty floor, lying on a pile of still dirtier
straw I found this poor prison boy dying. I fell on my
knees and poured out my heart to God in his behalf.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"That head had been pillowed on tenderest breast,</span>
<span class="i0">That form had been wept o'er, those lips had been pressed,</span>
<span class="i0">That soul had been prayed for in tones sweet and mild;</span>
<span class="i0">For her sake deal gently with some mother's child."</span>
</div>

<p>Do not tell me that it does not pay to labor and pray with
these dear lost ones. For if I can be the means of rescuing
but one soul from eternal punishment, thank God, it pays
me.</p>


<h4>WILL IT PAY?</h4>

<p>Some gentlemen were once looking at a large building
erected for newsboys, that they might be brought under
religious and refining influences. One of the spectators
asked a large contributor to the benevolent institution this
question: "Now you are erecting this building at a cost of
many thousands of dollars, and I admire your motives, but
suppose that after all this great expense only one boy was
saved here&mdash;would you still think it paid for time, labor
and money expended?" The man answered quickly and
earnestly, "Yes, sir; if it was my boy." The most precious
thing in the sight of God is a soul. For the redemption of
every soul on earth was paid the precious blood of the
Lamb of God. Count it not then a light thing in His sight
for one to be saved or lost. For "There is joy in the presence
of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth&mdash;more
than over ninety and nine just persons who need no
repentance." Hundreds have been saved under my observation
and instrumentality both inside and outside of prison
walls, and my motto has been, "Throw out the lifeline
across the dark wave."</p>


<h4>SAVED AND PREACHING THE GOSPEL.</h4>

<p>Upon a warm July day, starting to walk out from Bismarck,
N. D., to what I took to be the state's prison, but
which proved to be a large water reservoir, being overcome
by the heat I fell, and crawling to a shade I lay down with
my Bible under my head. After a time I saw some distance
away some persons driving in an open hack and signaled to
them till they saw me and came to me. They drove me to
the home of the warden of the prison where I was kindly
received by the warden's wife and made comfortable. Late
that night I held service in the prison corridors. This was
in 1885, and in 1901 I was leading a meeting in a mission in
Portland, Oregon, and asked all who had something special
for which to praise the Lord to speak. A brother arose and
said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I want to thank the Lord tonight for the privilege of hearing
'Mother' Wheaton preach outside of prison walls. I have heard
her in many a prison. Years ago, one night at 9 o'clock, when all
the prisoners had been locked in their cells, the officers unlocked
the doors to let this sister sing some hymns and hold services in
the corridors. One hymn that especially touched my heart was
'Throw out the life line.' I was an opium fiend, a morphine fiend,
a whisky fiend, and an all around bad man, and was ready to
despair. But God touched my heart and saved me and called me
to the ministry. At this time I was with my other sins a deserter
from the United States army. When my time expired I went and
gave myself up and was sentenced to five years more in prison.
But God had mercy on me and in seven months I was pardoned
out. Since that time I have lived an honest life, and for eight
years have preached the gospel."</p></blockquote>

<p>This man was married to a Christian woman and has
done much to rescue men from the pit from which he had
been taken, and is still preaching.</p>


<h4>IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.</h4>

<p>One Sunday I sang perhaps thirty hymns and preached
seven times to prisoners in solitary confinement, where I
dare not see them or clasp their hands as I do in other
prisons. There are hundreds there, and as I sang in all
the prison wards or corridors many different hymns, the
dear souls cheered and responded with their clear voices as
best they could to show their sincere appreciation of my efforts
to brighten their lonely prison life. Each was "some
mother's boy." Reader, is there not a sympathetic chord
in your heart for these poor unfortunates?</p>


<h4>CRAPE ON THE DOOR.</h4>

<p>I once felt impressed to go to a certain prison and hold
services. Arriving at the place early in the morning, I
thought I would go to the prison first before I would telephone
for a cousin who often helped me in the singing.
When I arrived at the prison, the chaplain said, "Mother
Wheaton, the Lord sent you to help me. To-day I have a
funeral service of a prisoner, something we have never had
at this prison." I did not telephone then for my cousin, as
the services were arranged. I worked all day in the prison,
holding services with both men and women prisoners, visited
the hospital, and went to the city jail at 5 p. m. and held
services, and then went to my relative's home and was greatly
shocked to find crape hanging on the door. I found my
cousin cold in death. Relatives asked me, "Who told you?"
I said, "God impressed me to come at this time." And I
went with them to the grave of my dear cousin, and kneeling
beside the open grave, I promised to faithfully do God's
holy will, and meet the departed one in Heaven.</p>


<h4>IN A POLICE STATION.</h4>

<p>In 1903, while I was in San Francisco, I was impressed
to go to the police station about nine o'clock one night. I
found, on arriving, an ambulance bringing in prisoners,
among them a woman who was arrested for drunkenness.
I talked and prayed with her. Hearing a noise like one in
distress, I walked on through the corridors and I found a
young soldier who was badly wounded in one eye and the
head. He was standing alone in his cell in great pain. The
bandage had been torn off, and the blood was running down
his face, though his wounds had evidently been dressed by
a physician before coming there. He was crying from the
pain, and was under the influence of drink. I wiped the
blood off his face, and put the bandage on his eye again.
Then I knelt in prayer with him. I left the city on an
early train, and never saw him again, but I believe God
heard and answered my prayer for his salvation.</p>


<h4>BURNED IN HIS CELL.</h4>

<p>I went into one of our western cities to hold services at
the jail. On the way from the depot I stopped at a store,
where a young clerk told me of a horrible crime that had
been committed in the jail. That the prisoners had been
trying to make their escape, and one young prisoner had
revealed the plot to the jailer, and thus saved his life. The
prison wall had been "worked" in a cunning manner, and
the prisoners were about to escape, when this poor boy informed
the jailer of what was being done. The other three
prisoners were so enraged that they threw coal oil over
the boy, set fire to his clothing, and he was burned alive in
the cell. I was grieved at hearing this, and felt that I could
see them punished severely. They were in an underground
prison for safe-keeping until the wall could be repaired.
The officers were afraid to let me go in, but I told them I
was not afraid, and went down the stairs ahead of the officers.
I saw only one dim candle burning, and called for a
light. A lamp was brought, and I went boldly into the
presence of those criminals. I sat down and thought of
the awfulness of it all. So, as I wept, I sang "Some Mother's
Boy," and they cried like their hearts were breaking. I
went over to them, where they were sitting together on an
old bunk, and we cried together. They were humble and
convicted, and it was love that did it all&mdash;God's love which
showed them that though their sins were as scarlet, they
shall be white as snow, though red like crimson they shall
be as wool. God heard prayer for them and I trust they
were forgiven.</p>


<h4>THE INNOCENT IN BONDS.</h4>

<p>In a certain state prison the officer called my attention to
a man and said, "That man is innocent of the crime he was
sentenced for." "Then why do you keep him here?" I
asked. "Because he serves for his friend, willingly allowing
the guilt to be placed upon himself rather than see this
friend who was really guilty suffer." On leaving the prison
I came upon this man with an officer on the train, and had
the pleasure of talking to the man and hearing his story. I
referred him to Psalms 15:1, 2, 4. "Lord, who shall abide in
thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that
walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness, and speaketh
the truth in his heart. He that sweareth to his own hurt,
and changeth not." He was being taken to another court
for trial.</p>


<h4>CONFESSED HER GUILT.</h4>

<p>A woman in a prison was convicted of sin under my
preaching, and sent for me to come to her cell, where she
gave me such an account of her crimes that I was shocked,
and yet was powerless to liberate an innocent man that she
said was in &mdash;&mdash; state's prison for a crime she committed.
She asked me to go and tell him for her that she was the
guilty one, and try to have him freed, but wanted the matter
kept secret. Now that she was under conviction of her
sins, she could not rest. I went to the state prison she
named, found the man, and told him her story. His agony
was pitiful to behold. He said, "O how I loved my wife
and baby. I am an innocent man. How can I live my sentence
out in this way? Nothing to live for." Such bitterness
as he held toward that wicked woman, for her crime
and duplicity! I left him in an agony of grief. And yet
there are so many who are serving as unjustly for others'
crimes! This woman had killed the wife thinking she herself
would then get the husband.</p>


<h4>UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH.</h4>

<p>Going into the presence of two condemned men on our national
holiday, the chaplain remarked, "I wish you could
reach these men's hearts. You have often helped others in
this prison who were under death sentence." I prayed in
silence for wisdom, and as I walked into their presence, I
said, "I have come to sing to you and have a little visit with
you, but if you prefer to be alone, I will go away." They
said they would be glad to have me stay. I sang several
songs, and before I had spoken of religion, I was made glad
to see tears in their eyes, and then we knelt in prayer, and I
prayed God to pardon their sins and make them pure in His
sight.</p>

<p>I do not believe in capital punishment. Lord hasten the
day when the crime of putting men to death legally shall
be done away with. It does not stop crime. I thank God
that one noble warden gave up his honorable position and
salary, rather than take the lives of any more men. I wish
God would raise up men all over our land who in like manner
would be brave enough to refuse to sacrifice human
lives because the law licenses them to do so. When I see
wicked men so anxious to see poor, helpless men executed,
I think of that authoritative utterance, "Vengeance is mine,
I will repay, saith the Lord." Jesus said, "He that hateth
his brother is a murderer." There is a day of reckoning
coming.</p>


<h4>THE RELIGION MOTHER HAD.</h4>

<p>Many times prisoners have said to me when speaking to
them, "That's the kind of religion mother had. You remind
me of my own dear old mother;" and many, even
statesmen, and the attendants in the capitol, and in the
President's mansion, have said to me with uncovered heads,
and tears in their eyes, "That is the kind of religion mother
had. I wish I was as good as she was." I find the crying
need to-day in all stations of life; from the palace to the
dungeon, is real, genuine, heartfelt, common-sense salvation,
not to be cranks and fanatics, not to be one-sided
or half-way professors of religion; but to have the Holy
Ghost in our hearts and lives, and a burning desire to help
every one into the Kingdom of Heaven. Being "all things
to all men" that we might win some wandering souls to
Christ.</p>

<p>O the joy of knowing that you are doing just what God
wants you to do&mdash;winning souls for His Kingdom, from all
walks of life; often in houses of ill-fame souls are truly
saved and reformed. Often in saloons men and women are
impressed by the straightforward message of love brought
them. You say, "No use to try." O thou of little faith,
wherefore did'st thou doubt? I have much encouragement
among the criminal classes, for they are despised and rejected
by earthly friends.</p>

<p>I might give many more instances, but this is probably
sufficient. Let no one think for a moment that these poor
unfortunates have no tender feeling, no remorse because
of sin. They see their shame and feel the separation from
home and loved ones. There must be places to confine
criminals and protect the lives and property of other people,
but we must remember that behind all the guilt there
are precious souls that live through all eternity.</p>

<p>Sin is treacherous, the human heart deceitful above all
things and desperately wicked; perhaps under unfavorable
conditions the heart of the most moral man or woman may
generate the evil of the human nature and cause it to show
its corruption in crime. All that saves some people now
from the felon's cell, or gambler's hell, is that they hold the
propensity of their corrupt hearts in with bit and bridle.
And thousands tread the earth in freedom, who, if justice
could find them out and fasten their guilt upon them, would
be in the prison stripes and iron cells. So be not so ready
to cry "Crucify him!" "Stone her!" until you can look
into your own heart and see that it is pure and clean.</p>

<h3>Conversion of Desperate Prisoners Prevents a Terrible
Mutiny.</h3>


<p>During the fall of 1888, I was deeply impressed that I
should visit the state prison at Waupun, Wis. Following
the guidance of the Spirit, I reached the place, after a
long journey, on the evening of November third. A dear
Christian girl was with me. It was a lovely moonlight
night and as we came to the prison, the yard was plainly
visible through the heavy iron grating. My companion
called my attention to its beauty but my heart was heavy
and I could only reply, "Sister, pray! O do pray! There
is something awfully wrong here&mdash;some danger pending&mdash;something
terrible!"</p>

<p>The officers of the prison welcomed me heartily and the
chaplain said: "I am glad you have come and shall be
pleased to have you take the service tomorrow morning."
(It was Saturday.) His wife entertained us during our
stay and after taking us to their own rooms he said:
"There's a man here who is a terror to both the officers
and prisoners. All are afraid of him. Neither kindness
or punishment seems to affect him. I wish you could do
something to help him." My reply was: "I cannot do
anything, but God can." And earnestly did I look to
God for help.</p>

<p>The next morning a heavy burden still rested upon my
heart and I prayed God to go before me to that prison
chapel and lead the meeting Himself and give me the
right message. Nor did I plead in vain, for many souls
were that day deeply convicted of sin and some were
blessedly saved as was clearly manifested a little later.</p>

<p>After the sermon my friend and myself sang a hymn and
this was greatly used by the Spirit in connection with the
sermon in reaching the very depths of hearts. It was the
custom to hold an after meeting for thirty minutes, but
those who wished to remain were expected to secure cards
or tickets, granting permission, on the previous day. That
Sunday the chaplain said: "All who wish to remain to this
service can do so without a card, as these ladies are here."</p>

<p>A hardened looking criminal (whom I afterward learned
to be the one to whom the chaplain had referred the night
before) arose to retire with a few others. I went to him at
once and took him by the hand and urged him to stay, but
he said: "No, they don't want me here. This meeting is
for good people and I am too bad to stay." But I pleaded:
"No, you stay&mdash;we want you to stay. I want you to stay."
And then he said: "Well, I'll stay for your sake," and sat
down. The meeting progressed under the power of the
Lord and many arose to say that they had been very wicked
but were sorry; and if God could and would forgive them
they would lead a different life and be good men. Some told
how their dear old mothers were good and had prayed for
them and that they wanted us to pray for them and they
would serve the Lord.</p>

<p>I noticed that many of the men as they arose glanced furtively
at the man to whom I have referred and that he sat
looking at each one as he spoke and evidently had great influence
over the other prisoners. At last he arose and said,
"Men, don't be afraid of me. If there is any good in this
religion you are talking about, go ahead and get it. I'll
stand by you and nobody shall say before me, 'There's your
praying man' or 'There's your hypocrite.' I can't be good&mdash;I'm
too far gone&mdash;but I'll stand by the men who are going
to do right." All were evidently deeply impressed by his
words. As he sat down I went to him and taking him by
the hand, I said, "God loves you and He wants to save you
and to help you to live for a better world than this." Again
he insisted, "I'm too far gone! It's too late for me to try
to do right! There's no hope for me," but still I pleaded
with him to return unto the Lord&mdash;that there was still mercy
and pardon for even him&mdash;and that he would yield to the
Holy Spirit's pleading and become a Christian. He was
evidently very deeply convicted of sin and soon arose and
with deep feeling he said, "Men, you know what I have
been&mdash;watch me from today and see what I will be;" and
as he sat down, the prisoners cheered.</p>

<p>Fearful as to what the outcome might be and somewhat
doubting his sincerity, the chaplain quickly closed the service
and ordered the men to their cells. They obediently left
the chapel, but truly God had wondrously wrought that day
in the hearts of many of the most noted and hardened criminals.
In the afternoon we went, in company with the chaplain,
from cell to cell singing, talking, and praying with the
men. The chaplain took me to the cell of the man who had
given so much trouble&mdash;a man who had taken several lives,
and there he gave his heart to God and was converted.</p>


<h4>PLAN OF THE MUTINY.</h4>

<p>After all the prisoners had been locked in the cells and
the officers had gone to their homes or rooms, only a few
guards remaining on duty, he sent for the warden to come
to his cell and requested to be taken out into the prison
yard. At first the warden refused to do so because of his
being known to be such a dangerous character. Still he insisted,
saying that he had something to show him. The warden,
who had been an army officer and was a very brave
man, was only partially convinced but finally consented saying:
"I'm not afraid of you&mdash;one wrong move and you're
a dead man. I have had enough trouble with you. I will
take you into the yard, but beware!"</p>

<p>Well armed, he marched the man into the yard. There
the prisoner led him to the extreme end, and taking away
some dry leaves and boards he said to the warden, "Look
in." The warden did so and, O, what a sight met his eyes!
There, in a hole, were knives, guns, and other weapons!
Staggering back he exclaimed, "My &mdash;&mdash;, where did you
get those things?" "It don't matter where I got them,"
replied the prisoner, "but take me back to my cell and then
take away these weapons. I intended to liberate the prison
tomorrow morning and would have done so if that woman
had not come and preached here today. I am a changed
man now."</p>

<p>How he got those weapons was a mystery, but he had
been long years planning an escape, and had chosen some of
the most daring of his fellow prisoners (both those inside
and others who had gone out) to aid him! Whether he
could have succeeded or not, doubtless many lives either of
officers or prisoners or of both would have been lost had
the attempt been made. But God wrought so mightily that
instead of lives being lost precious souls were saved. Several
were converted that day who are still living noble Christian
lives. Others may be,&mdash;I leave that with God. I do
not know whether the leader is still living or not, but have
heard that he was dead. At any rate he served his long
sentence and claimed to be still a Christian when he left
the prison.</p>


<h4>HAVOC OF SIN.</h4>

<p>Among the many who were converted during that Sunday
morning service in 1888, was a very amiable, intelligent, refined-appearing
young man, still in his teens, who was serving
under life sentence. He was a real "mother's boy,"
so young and so small that after his conversion I used to
call him my little son. He belonged to one of the best families
of the state. His father was a physician and a classmate
and friend of the governor. For the sake of his broken-hearted
parents, as well as his own, and being satisfied
that he was really innocent of the crime of which he had
been convicted, I began to pray earnestly for his release.
But the case dragged on and though he was pardoned some
years later, it was not until after his father died broken-hearted
and the mother's health had failed under her weight
of sorrow and an aunt had gone insane.</p>

<p>During his imprisonment I at one time visited his poor
mother in her home. Oh! what havoc sin had wrought!
What sorrow! For though I believe him entirely innocent
of the crime for which he was condemned, his conviction
was the result of his being led astray by evil influences and
associates.</p>

<p>Oh, that I could warn young men of the dangers of bad
company, and that I could warn parents of the dangers of
discouraging their children in waiting upon and serving
God.</p>

<p>When this boy was quite young, he wanted to become a
Christian and engage in work for souls, but his parents
thought it would be a disgrace, as they were aristocratic,
but alas! what snares had the enemy set for him, from
which he might have entirely escaped, if they had encouraged
him to be true to God.</p>

<p>I received many letters from him while he was in prison
and quote from two of them. We have not heard from him
for years but trust that if alive he is still living for God
and Heaven.</p>


<blockquote><p class="head">
Waupun, Wis., July 7, 1895.</p>

<p>Dear Mother, "In His Name":
</p>

<p>Since my last letter to you several things of interest have transpired.
My attorney went to see the governor and then came to
see me. We went over some evidence, and at last I convinced them
that I alone can untangle the skein of false evidence.</p>

<p>I located a Mrs. N. and she gave an affidavit which would have
cleared me at my trial. She said she felt that she had been the
cause of all my suffering, but that she went to LaCrosse at the
time of my trial and was met at the train by a detective, who told
her if she wanted to keep out of serious trouble to take the first
train out of the city, and she did so. I expect to soon have another
witness to corroborate her statement. Then if I can locate the
sister of the deceased and get her evidence I will have a sure case
against those who perjured themselves to send me here.</p>

<p>Yes, I have placed all my life in God's hands and have begun
my work here; but, being a convict, I am much hindered. Therefore,
in order to do a more abundant and faithful service, I desire
my freedom. If I get it, I will try and enter the Moody Institute
and take a course of training for the work. Mrs. K. is anxious to
have me do so.</p>

<p>Our chaplain will preside over our Christian Endeavor Society.
I recently sent out my report to be read at the Boston convention
in session the 10th inst., and I ventured, in the light of all events,
to place the following motto over our penitentiary: "Wisconsin
Prison for Christ" for the coming year, and by the time of the
next convention, I hope to be out to represent the Christian Endeavor
boys.</p>

<p>Brother H. told me of a song you sing. "Some Mother's Child"
is the song. Will says it is simply sublime and I ought to have it.
Such songs turn the mind back to home and to the memory of fond
parents and loved ones. Such pieces are always very sacred to me.</p>

<p>God bless you and spare you for many years to come, that you
may continue to be a Mother to the prisoners of earth. Write me
when you can.</p>

<p>I am your loving little son, "In His Name,"</p>

<p>My Dear Mother:
</p>

<p>Your excellent letter duly at hand. Both Brother Colgrove and
I were surprised, for we had concluded that God in His infinite
love and wisdom had carried you home.</p>

<p>I am at work here in the official building, in the office of our dear
chaplain. Brother Colgrove is in the hospital across the hall from
our office. I have talked with the chaplain about your coming, and
he says to tell you to come and stay two weeks. He would like to
have you spend two Sundays, and in the meantime we will no doubt,
under the present warden, be able to secure the evenings during the
week for a series of revival meetings.</p>

<p>Lovingly your son in the work,</p>

<h3>Remarkable Conversion and Experience of George H.
Colgrove.</h3>


<p>Among the others who
were saved that fourth
day of November, 1888,
at Waupun, Wis., was
the very remarkable case
of Geo. H. Colgrove.
Years afterwards the
chaplain said of him, "I
regard him as an ideal&mdash;one
of whom you would
expect this report: 'If
ever there was a good
Christian man on earth
he is one.'" At one time
he had three Bible classes
in prison each week&mdash;one
in English and two
in German&mdash;and was
the means of the accomplishment
of much good
in the conversion of
prisoners.</p>

<span class="caption">GEO. H. COLGROVE.</span>
</div>


<h4>HIS OWN STORY.</h4>

<p>The story of his life and conversion is given, as nearly
as possible, in his own words, but as found in two different
statements&mdash;some particulars being given in one that were
not in the other&mdash;in order to make the account as complete
as I can.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is very difficult for one in prison, especially, to write of themselves
without giving to strangers the impression of either vanity
and conceit on the one hand or of craft and deception on the other.
Therefore, it is with considerable hesitation that I write. Yet my
greet indebtedness to "Mother" Wheaton, who was chosen of God
as the agent through whom His wondrous work should be made manifest
to the world in my salvation, as also of many others, has at last
led me to make the following statement:</p>

<p>Just on the verge of manhood, at the age of nineteen, I obtained
some <em>infidel literature</em> of the mild stamp, yet scholarly and persuasive
withal, containing no harsh criticism of Christian people and
principles. This aroused my interest and admiration and led to my
obtaining more of a like nature, until under their combined influence
my youthful mind was entirely surrendered to such doubts and disbelief
as they advocated.</p>

<p>This was the pivotal point in my early life from which I started
down the deceitful road that leads from peace, happiness and honor
into the depths of sorrow, infamy and despair. Having thus imbibed
the subtle poison of infidelity, I soon became blinded and indifferent
to the rights of my fellowmen and to the enormity of violating
divine law.</p>

<h5>
BURGLARY AND MURDER.</h5>

<p>From this low plane of morality it was easy to enter the path
of crime; and this I did, following the precarious calling of burglary
for five years. This dark way ended in the midnight gloom of a murderer.
Detection, arrest and conviction followed in rapid succession,
soon bringing down upon me the crushing weight of a "life sentence."
So that on a cold wintry night the officers of the law
delivered me within the portals of a living tomb.</p>

<p>Four dark, hopeless, weary years succeeded. Yet the Lord in His
great mercy had not forgotten me; and when all the world deserted
me, then He in His loving kindness took me up and His favor was
manifested through the instrumentality of "Mother" Wheaton.</p>

<p>During the early years of my incarceration no words could portray
my intense and bitter hatred of Christianity and anything pertaining
thereto. Feeling that I had sold my soul to the prince of darkness,
it enraged me to be reminded of a better life, or a possible
Heaven.</p>

<p>Burning with the fires of hatred and revenge toward those whom
I knew had unjustly deceived and wronged me, my only desire was
to escape from here even long enough to rush upon my enemies and
hurl their souls into eternity, and then follow them immediately if
need be. I continually planned and schemed for the accomplishment
of this purpose, and had a plan of escape well defined and was making
arrangements to put it into execution, when one bright and beautiful
Sunday morning it was announced that a lady preacher was
going to hold services in the chapel that day.</p>

<p>Though I did not often attend church, yet on this occasion I swore
some big round oaths that I would go up and hear the lady talk.</p>

<p>That was the morning of November 4, 1888. The beautiful sun
that shines alike on mansion and cottage, palace and prison, shone as
though a special degree of radiance had been granted to light a benighted
soul on its way out of darkness into light. But I entered
the chapel with cold indifference, drawn only by curiosity&mdash;at least
so far as I knew; but results proved that God was leading. I awaited
developments; <em>and they came</em>. Our prison chaplain introduced
"Mother" Wheaton, whom I had never seen before, and announced
the services as "entirely in her hands." She gave us a short, earnest,
impressive address; then she and the sister who came with her sang
"Meet me there."</p>

<p>During the singing I heard an accompanying strain, low and inexpressibly
sweet, the like of which I had never heard nor imagined.</p>

<p>The two sounds harmonized, yet were distinct, but oh, how lovely!
Words fail to convey the most distant idea of their soothing and attractive
power.</p>

<p>The thought flashed through my mind, "That is delicious music
to fall upon ears that have listened to the sound of murderous guns."</p>

<p>Suddenly and with all the vividness of continuous lightning dispelling
dense darkness, revealing all surrounding objects distinctly,
the awful depth and blackness of my iniquitous career blazed up before
my mental view, like a clear and definite painting of each act
in my wicked life&mdash;portrayed on canvas by a master hand and set
in clearest rays of the noonday sun. And at the same time there
was given an assurance of forgiveness, if accepted then.</p>

<p>Surprise, consternation and intense fear came with this revelation
of myself to myself, as my depraved spiritual condition was, for the
first time, fully realized. Also as distinctly and positively it was
granted me to know that <em>my last opportunity</em> for divine favor was
before me. Accept and be saved or reject and be <em>eternally lost</em>!
Such was the alternative.</p>

<p>Although every nerve thrilled in rebellion against Christianity
and a thousand obstacles seemed to intervene, rendering a change in
my course of life impossible, yet I dared not refuse that stern, terrific
ultimatum, "<em>Your last opportunity</em>," and before its mighty
mandate my proud, headstrong, sin-burdened soul <em>surrendered unto
Jesus of Nazareth</em>.</p>

<p>I wished to fly from the room, but could not. I felt frightened
at the power which was mastering me, and thought in a confused
way of the ridicule which would be heaped upon me, of my intended
escape, and of revenge upon my foes. Ah! what? Revenge? No,
no revenge now. No, no. That was all gone. The evil desire had
thus suddenly been removed without my knowledge, and in its stead
there reigned in my heart and in the depths of my soul a feeling of
forgiveness and peace, both between them and myself and between
myself and my God.</p>

<p>I said, "Surely the Lord has visited me this day; for I came in
here a devil in human form, and now my dark sins are forgiven
and I am free. Glory to God!"</p>

<p>The chaplain and warden were nearly thunderstruck to learn that
the low, miserable, worthless wretch, the hopeless vagabond, Colgrove,
had been brought to the foot of the cross; still they must have entertained
but little hope of my remaining in the straight and narrow
path that leadeth unto life. How could they? They had not
heard that strange music which had floated in on my soul. They
could not feel the awakening which was permeating and ringing
through the corridors of my heart, nor could they perceive the realizing
sense of divine favor which was so clear to my own consciousness.</p>

<p>That very week it was impressed on my mind that I must at once
commence the study of the Holy Scriptures for work in the cause
of God and devote the remainder of my life to leading my fellowmen,
and especially prisoners, into the light of Calvary. I said,
"What will it all amount to&mdash;I a friendless prisoner, doomed for
life?" An answering whisper came, "Friendless, with Jesus for
your friend? Study the Word." So in blindness, with fear and
trembling, doubts and misgivings, I took from my shelf in the prison
cell the neglected, despised and dust-covered Bible and commenced
studying the Word to the best of my ability, with none but God to
direct or assist me except a hasty explanation now and then from
the chaplain as he passed on his hurried rounds through the cell
rooms.</p>

<p>I immediately destroyed the implements of destruction and escape
which I had made during two years previous to my conversion. Instead
of dirks and saws, my hands now grasped the Bible and the
cross; and thanks be unto Jesus of Nazareth, they still retain their
hold, and I believe with ever increasing strength.</p>

<p>The way thus far has been rendered more pleasant by the hand
of the Lord than I then thought possible amid such dark surroundings.
With an ever realizing sense of my unworthiness I have been
kindly led in the way of life and am eleven years nearer my eternal
Home; while in my soul there is the "peace of God which passeth
all understanding" which is an additional evidence of the faithful
care and guidance of Jehovah. During the last decade the motto of
my life has been, as through future years it shall ever be (Isaiah
26:4): "Trust ye in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah
is everlasting strength."</p>

<p>I know not whether earthly freedom will ever be mine, but I do
know that, if it is His holy and righteous will, it will be given me;
and I know that it matters little, for earthly joys must soon fade
away, and down at the close of the earthly journey Jesus is waiting
for me. And with my weak and faltering hand laid in His strong
and mighty one I shall walk through the dark waters of the Jordan
of death, and with Him kindly leading His rescued child we shall
enter with joy and eternal thanksgiving the beautiful "city whose
maker and builder is God."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following extracts from letters written me at different
times after his conversion will, I believe, interest the
reader:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Waupun, Wis., Sept. 5, 1891.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. Wheaton:
</p>

<p>Dear Christian Friend: No news received since you were here
has afforded me so much pleasure as the announcement of your return.</p>

<p>It was through your earnest work that I was converted. When
you came here before there was, I presume, no more sinful, hopeless,
hardened, miserable wretch inside these walls than myself. When I
entered the prison chapel that Sabbath morning, November 4, 1888,
I for one came to observe, sneer and laugh. But while you were
singing that glorious anthem, "Meet Me There," power from above
opened my spiritual vision to see the horrible condition of my soul,
and so enabled me to realize my great need of divine favor. I thank
God and will bless His holy name forever that in His infinite wisdom
and kindness He brought me inside these walls and sent you, His
chosen instrument, to lead my wandering sin-darkened soul into the
path that leadeth unto life eternal.</p>

<p>Amid the trials, cares and vexations of the passing days I often
look up to the blue vault of heaven's dome and rejoice at the thought
that the flying moments and hastening hours are bringing me nearer,
ever nearer to the blessed hour when I shall meet Jesus face to face
and clasp His rescuing hand, never from Him to part. Ah, never
to part! Thanks unto God most high.</p>

<p>May the Lord ever bless you, my dear spiritual Mother. Good-bye.</p>

<p>My Dear Spiritual Mother:
</p>

<p>Your kind letter most gladly received. I am surprised that our
boys do not write more frequently to you. They often inquire as to
your whereabouts and health and ever have a good word for you and
your work. Even many who do not care for their soul's salvation
speak favorably of Mrs. Wheaton.</p>

<p>God knows how much your letters cheer me and brighten the
prison gloom. After twenty years of infidelity, with all its direful
train of evils, leading on from bad to worse, the prison gate threw
its protective barrier between society and one who had become almost
a devil in human form, thus showing that a just God had taken account
of my iniquitous course and had said, "Thus far and no farther."
Then followed four years of hopeless misery, borne with the
sullen stolidity of despair, while in thought, intent and purpose I
sank lower and lower into the horrible cesspool of criminality, and
farther and farther away from God. Then, in His infinite mercy,
He sent you with the message of salvation, which He crowned with
His invincible power of conviction and a realization of my lost and
hopeless condition.</p>

<p>My prayers shall ever be with you, dear sister, and if I might send
a message by you to all the prisoners from the pine-shadowed shores
of Maine to the far Alaskan mountains it would be this: "Ye captives,
look aloft to the Star of Bethlehem, and whatever betide, do
not fail to grasp the hand stretched out to you from Calvary."
Hoping to hear from you soon and praying God to ever bless you I
remain,</p>

<p>My Dear Mother:
</p>

<p>How many, many times I have thanked our kind Father above and
praised His Holy Name for sending you to our prison gate on that
November night in 1888. Three years and ten months ago today the
radiant light of Calvary, fresh from the throne of the Infinite, came,
through your ministrations, down into the dark recesses of my sin-burdened
heart and crime-laden soul, while mingled with the music
of the sweet hymn you and your companion were singing the heavenly
strains of an angelic accompaniment so entrancingly and irresistibly
soothing and lovely that my hardened heart melted like frost
before the noonday sun.</p>

<p>Can you believe that I stayed to that after-meeting when every
nerve in my body thrilled to get up and run out of the chapel? Yes,
I desired to flee; yet an irresistible power restrained me. I know
now it was Satan urging me to flee away from there; for he, of
course, readily understood that he was in danger of losing an active
member from his minions of evil. But thanks be unto Jehovah, who
ruleth over all, Satan failed. God and His servant held the field
and a soul was redeemed from death. Glory to God forever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p>The years from that time have been so pleasant and bright, though
spent where sorrow, misery and gloom were on every hand, as I journey
on to our beautiful home everlasting, which Jesus has gone to
prepare.</p>

<p>Yes, since your first visit here my bark of life has been "standing
away" on her new course over the sea of life, and she is now
nearly four years nearer the heavenly harbor, where destructive gales
of temptation will never sweep the white sails of purity from the
"masts of purpose," nor break the "yard arms" of effort, nor
rolling breakers of iniquity dash her upon the rocky shore of eternal
ruin.</p>

<p>Mother, please give my kindest wishes to all who are helping you
in the great work which Jesus established while on earth and which
He left for us to continue until the resounding trump and advancing

shall again whiten the seas with their snowy sails and bring their
passengers and crews to join the vast congregation assembled before

<p>Dear Mother:
</p>

<p>Your kind and most welcome letter very gladly received. It is
ever one of my chief pleasures to hear from you.</p>

<p>There was a man here by the name of William L., who led a very
godless life, being extremely profane. During the past summer he
was transferred to the prison hospital. On September 4 I was
placed in charge of the sick ward as assistant steward, and I found
this man L. in here when I took charge of this department. He
had been a bitter enemy of mine for several years, as he was utterly
opposed to Christianity, and he tried to utterly disregard me. I
continued to treat him kindly, which was, of course, a Christian duty
which we owe to our Heavenly Father, and in a short time he grew
into the habit of calling on me for favors, and as he sank lower I
spent the night with him. One evening he spoke of you and said:
"Oh! I wish I could hear 'Mother' Wheaton sing one of her sweet
hymns."</p>

<p>During three days and nights he continued to speak of you. The
last day on which he mentioned you was in the morning about 8
o'clock. While sitting in his chair beside the bed he said very earnestly
and emphatically: "I would give a dollar to hear 'Mother'
Wheaton sing one of her sweet hymns just now&mdash;right here and
now."</p>

<p>About midnight that night he sat in his bed looking upward for
some time in silence and then dropped his head in a most dejected
manner and in mournful tone exclaimed, "No, no, no." The intense
sadness of his manner made my heart ache for him. After that hour
he appeared to have given up all hope. The death chill came on
while he was in the rocking chair, and he asked me to assist him into
bed and send for the prison physician. He expressed himself well
satisfied with the treatment he had had while sick, and then, seeing it
was too hard work for him to talk, he relapsed into silence, while I
offered a silent prayer for the departing soul.</p>

<p>I write this explanation because of the intense desire he had
to see you and hear you sing once more.</p>

<p>The Christian Endeavor still exists by the power and blessing of
God, and my Bible class is continuing and some good has been accomplished
through its instrumentality.</p>

<p>Rev. B. has left us. Our new spiritual guide and counselor is
Rev. Simerville, an earnest Christian, whose influence bids fair to
lead many hitherto careless ones to turn their footsteps in the
straight and narrow path that leads to life. The beacon light to
Calvary cheers us on every day to our eternal home. Meet me there.
Good-bye, Mother. God bless you now and ever.</p>

have recommendations from many parties, and from my trial judge,
Hon. A. Scott Sloan. My jury did not support my application, but
the judge did. He is now dead, but he gave me a splendid letter,
and it should be just as effective. I shall have to ask you to wait
for your reward, until freedom comes to me, and then you will not
be forgotten. I hope Sister Kelley can accompany you on your
Madison trip.</p>

<p>I received a letter from your friend Miss Josephine Cowgill, Jerusalem,

<p>Dear Mother:
</p>

<p>Inclosed please find copy of letter just received from Executive
Clerk. It will be useful perhaps as a reference when you reach
Madison. The entire recommendation from my judge is there as is
stated herein. My judge is now deceased. A letter received today
from ex-Chaplain T. J. Brown, now of Lancaster, Wisconsin, informs
me that he will gladly meet you at Madison, and assist you in any way
possible. One of our officers is also making arrangements with a
Madison party to join you at that time. So we seem well favored
and I regard it as indicative of divine favor, for all the present
participants are Christians and we may therefore hope for especial
favor from our heavenly Father.</p>

<p>Mr. G. H. Colgrove, State Prison, Waupun.
</p>

<p>My Dear Sir: I have looked up the matter about which you wrote
me on Oct. 21st, and find there is a letter from Judge Sloan among
your papers. This letter says, among other things: "If it be true
that Mr. Colgrove has behaved himself well during his imprisonment

<p>Dear Mother and Sister:
</p>

<p>Your kind letters of 24th ult, duly at hand, and as you wrote in
unison, I hope this companion letter will be acceptable. I am pleased
to learn that your book work is progressing and will soon be launched
upon the restless sea of activity, and accomplishing good work
under the divine blessing, leading souls into the light that never
shall fade while Eternity rolls its unending years. Sorry that so
much sickness and suffering has fallen to the lot of each of you,
but rejoice that it is passed and can not assail you again in this
world, and in the world to come "There shall be no more pain;
for the former things are passed away." There, the cheeks which
we here beheld pale with suffering and tear-stained by sorrow, will
be mantling with the rich glow of everlasting health and radiant in
the matchless loveliness of deathless bloom. A refreshing rain has
broken a long drouth here, and the world looks lovely and sparkling
in the golden sunlight this beautiful May morning. As we behold
the face of the earth beautified by the hand of God, it is a source
of regret that all this harmony of nature, this smiling peace and
bloom, is marred and clouded by the dark stain which iniquity has
brought into this fair world; and the sad, stern fact confronts us,
that "The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of
cruelty." But it is true. Peace in its entirety, and purity in divine
perfection, are fled from this world, and we cannot possess them in
full until we have passed beyond Jordan's cold wave and through
the dark portals which intervene between this sin-darkened land
and the glory crowned hills of Immanuel's Land. But it is a soul-cheering
fact that we are daily and hourly nearing that blest clime
where sin and sorrow can no more cast the cloud of estrangement
between us and the Divine Master who arose triumphant over sin
and death and in His eternal majesty and power has gone to prepare
for our home coming.</p>

<p>Though our barque of life may be tossed by violent seas of strife,
and meet with disaster in various forms, so long as we know that
Jesus is awaiting us in the Harbor of Peace we are not dismayed by
the howling blast nor raging billows of earthly storm, but relying on
His unfailing promise we keep in mind the coming greeting of the
great Master and remember</p>

</div>

<p>Yes, Mother, I too am glad and thankful that the Lord sent you
to Waupun and into our chapel on that glorious autumn morning,
Nov. 4, 1888. Surely the good work then accomplished has not been
extinguished, although Satan has exerted himself to cast dark clouds
of misunderstanding, strife and contention over it all. But the light
of Calvary shines amid the gloom, the heavenly sheen of the cross of
Christ sheds a halo of undying and imperishable glory over all, that
like the pillar of fire that led the hosts of Israel through the wilderness,
will lead and sustain each weary heart, until we arrive on Jordan's
banks, and raise the song of everlasting triumph, as we view
our eternal home.</p>

welfare, I remain,</p>

<p>The following letter from a dear sister who is deeply interested
in prison work is inserted here because of its reference
to Brother Colgrove:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 19, 1900.</p>

<p>My Dear Mother Wheaton:
</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how very glad I was to hear from you; and
to know that you have been blest all along the way, is indeed good
news. Some one asked the question, "What is the best thing that
can be said of a friend?" Many answers were given, one good one
being "He rests me," but the best answer was "He inspires me."
This can be truly said of you. No one more than yourself inspires me
to live a true Christian life. I do want to be ready at all times to
serve Christ.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Just ready to do His bidding,</span>
<span class="i0">If only I do His will.</span>
<span class="i0">Then I will be ready to meet him</span>
<span class="i0">When shadows flee away</span>
<span class="i0">Ready to serve Him perfectly</span>
<span class="i0">When dawns eternal day."</span>
</div>

<p>Last week we had another meeting at the Soldiers' Home. You
cannot imagine how we missed you. So many of the sick men
inquired for you. One said if you would only come back he would
shout for joy. Of course it made me very happy to know that they
had received such a blessing from your talk. This same man said he
had prayed for you every night.</p>

<p>The young man that called for you to come out to see him in the
jail was sent to St. Cloud for two and a half years. The poor
colored man was sent to State's Prison at Stillwater for five years.</p>

<p>The strangest thing has happened since the last time Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;
was at Waupun. Mr. Colgrove's wife, whom he had not heard from
for twelve years, has been to see him. His young lady daughter,
whom he thought dead, is living. Is not that precious news? I
am sure Mr. Colgrove must be the happiest man inside of these walls
just now. Had a good letter from S. yesterday.</p>

<p>I have Christmas cards for all of the women and some for the men
in the prison. Must say good bye.</p>

<p class="signature">
Your sincere friend and sister in Christ,<br />
<span class="smcap">Gertrude M.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>From an editorial written by Brother Colgrove while editor
of the Christian Endeavor Department of the prison
paper published at Waupun, we clip the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps our uninformed friends may infer that we advocate the
abolition of all punishment in penal institutions. Not at all, brother;
nothing so absurd. But we do claim and will maintain to our dying
hour that punishment should be judicious, and only when the culprit
will not heed any humane treatment nor be influenced by admonition.</p>

<p>When punishment and imposition are used at the mere caprice
of some low down scoundrel, instead of discretionary treatment,
at the behest of a man of sense, reason and upright principle, the
effect has ever been, and will ever be, to develop the worst traits inherent
in the nature of the individual whom the laws have already
pronounced unsafe, and when released, the consequences of that
development, are going to fall on some innocent and unoffending
member of the law-abiding class. When we consider the vast amount
of mischief which one criminal can accomplish in an incredibly short
space of time, have we not cause to be thankful that all over our
land are self-sacrificing souls, brave men and women, who are determined
in the face of all opposition, ridicule and every evil, to use
every possible means within their power, to elevate and reform all
of the criminal class, who may by any means be led from the old
path of sorrow and misery to themselves and danger to the peace and
well-being of their brother men?</p>

<p>Men and women who will place in the hand of the prisoner the
Bible, in exchange for the revolver, dagger and bottle? The citizen
in his quiet home, who is unacquainted with the prison systems of
the various forms which are being used in different states, depends
entirely upon the laws of the land to secure him in the peaceful possession
of his accumulated earnings. But experience proves that
human law alone and unassisted by higher power <em>is not sufficient to
guard the home from intrusion and desecration by those who have
no regard for right principles</em>. The man who has criminal tendencies,
and is not striving to restrain them in conformity to divine law, will
laugh the human power to scorn, and trample the law of man under
his feet whenever there seems an opportunity of financial gain thereby.
<em>The man who has been led to observe and rightly regard the
divine law will have no occasion for inducement for infringing on the
laws of the land.</em> Therefore these reformers, both clergy and laity,
<em>are striking at the very root of crime, when they lift the fallen
out of the slough of vice and iniquity</em>, and <em>turn his face toward the
higher life and the city "whose maker and builder is God."</em></p></blockquote>

<p>During the fall of 1903 I received several letters telling
me that Brother George Colgrove could live but a short
time. In December, 1903, I visited again the prison at
Waupun. I found Brother Colgrove in the Prison Hospital,
very weak in body, but peaceful and resting in the Saviour's
love. Once more he related to the young sister who was
with me the wonderful story of his conversion; and how
for over fifteen years he had been kept by the power of
God, saved and filled with love for God and souls. We
knelt and prayed with him and sang his favorite hymns and
as I bade him farewell he said, "Sister, if we never meet
on earth again I will meet you in Heaven."</p>

<p>That was our final parting. Brief notes from the chaplain
and warden informed me that Brother Colgrove died February
19, 1904, and that funeral services (an unusual thing)
were held in the prison chapel February 21. The warden's
letter contains this testimony. "He died a Christian."</p>

<p>Bless God for his sustaining grace that is sufficient even
amid the trials of a prison life and enabled this one of his
children to prove true to God for so many years, inside of
prison walls!</p>

<p>O how wonderful is the power of God to seek and to
save that which was lost!</p>

<h3>Work in Stockades and Prison Camps in Southern
States.</h3>


<p>During the first years of my missionary work I was led
to stay much of the time in the South. I was learning lessons
in patience, faith and humility before God. The cross
was very heavy. In many places I was not allowed to stay
with white people if I preached to the negroes. <small>THE RACE
QUESTION</small> ran high and the color line was very closely
drawn. In those days I could not understand why this
should be. I was taught in the word of God that all nations
were made of one blood and that God was the Father
of us all. I was ignorant and the views of the southern people
were new to me. In many cases, perhaps, I offended
them when I might have avoided it. I knew no better and
they often thought me obstinate. But I was only obeying
God the very best I knew in trying to keep immortal souls
out of hell, and I knew that I must obey God though all
the people should misunderstand and misjudge me. I
found nearly all of the prisoners of the South confined in
Stockades and Prison Camps. In many cases the prisons
themselves were almost empty.</p>

<h4>A STOCKADE.</h4>

<p>Many inquire of me what a stockade or prison camp is. I
will here explain. A man, or party of men, lease or hire
from the state the labor of a certain number of prisoners for
a certain length of time. They are "doing time," as the
prisoners say, for the state. Both men and women are thus
leased out. Their labor is used in clearing up land, working
in cotton and sugar cane fields, in mines, in turpentine
camps, in building railroads, on brick-yards, in phosphate
works or in any place where a company can work together.
Their food consists mostly of swine's flesh and corn bread
made with meal, water and salt.</p>

<p>The stockades are large rough wooden buildings, erected
by the lessee, in which the prisoners are confined at night.
The men are generally chained by one ankle to a heavy
chain which reaches through the center of the building from
one end to the other, being securely fastened to strong posts.
They usually sleep on the floor in the same clothing worn
through the day&mdash;which is generally very scant and poor;
but sometimes they may have a bunk and a rough dirty
blanket. The stockade is guarded by men with loaded
guns, and besides this every camp is abundantly supplied
with great, strong bloodhounds. And woe to the unfortunate
criminal that must be tracked and caught by them!</p>

<p>Each prison camp has its mode of punishment for those
who break the rules or fail to do as much as is allotted to
them. The keepers of past years were often very cruel in
their treatment, and seemed to enjoy the punishment which
they inflicted upon those under their control. These poor
souls had no way of redress. If they should speak of the
cruelty, they would be treated far worse; the penalty for
such a complaint being a severe whipping. Oh, God, how
long shall the cry of the prisoner be heard? Lord Jesus,
come quickly!</p>

<p>Each camp has its officers, guards, etc., among whom is
the whipping boss. And God pity the man or woman who
falls into his cruel hands. There is a board of prison inspectors,
the president of which travels from place to place
looking after the interests of all. The conditions of the
stockades are much improved since I first went among them
years ago. I have gone to the governors of different states
and pleaded for the betterment of conditions in the prisons.
Especially have I asked that the women might have better
treatment and not be whipped so brutally for slight offenses
or violation of the rules which the lessee is allowed to make.
Upon one occasion I wrote the governor of a certain state
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Washington, D. C., May 10, 18&mdash;.</p>

<p>To His Excellency the Governer of &mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<p>Dear Brother: I write in behalf of the prisoners in your state prison
at B. M. I find them greatly in need of food and clothing. The
sick prisoners are suffering with hunger. I held services there one
week ago today, and went into the kitchen myself to see what there
was for sixteen sick men and those who are supposed to wait on them,
and I found only one half gallon of milk a day for all, one chicken,
very poor bread, no vegetables, no fruits, and no seasoning but
salt. Who is to blame for this? I find you feed those prisoners
(miners and farmers) on seven cents a day.</p>

<p>It is an outrage, a sin, a curse on this nation, the suffering you
men, you governors or officers, at least allow to exist in prison walls.
You permit those men in B. M. prison to be whipped for not furnishing
daily from three to five small car loads of coal each, and feed
them on food not sufficient to give them strength to perform that
amount of labor. God help you, my friend! As you are the first
officer of the state you should see that this inhuman treatment is
stopped.</p>

<p>Forty men were whipped in one day on two occasions, and on an
average there are from six to eight every day. These men are not
murmuring, I gave them no chance to tell me of this. But the officers
and their wives told me. I saw with my own eyes. The water
in those mountains is very impure and many of the men have died
from mere neglect. Many more will die soon unless something is
done for their relief. Governor, for God's sake, please look after
the temporal interests of your prisoners. I would have come to you
face to face and talked these things over if possible. Recently I
have been to see governors of several of the different states. They
are not aware of the treatment of convicts in their own states, but
I have seen it all these years of my pilgrimage. The awful suffering
I see is just breaking my heart. Poor lost men and women! Who
is responsible for the sin and crime and suffering? Largely the
saloon. Men and women are born in sin and conceived in iniquity;
shut in for years and years for some little crime, and subjected to
the hardest labor, serving out sentence in prison under whip and lash.
It is inhuman and unjust. What will God Almighty require of you
and me in the day of judgment, For surely we must meet it and
answer for our stewardship here on earth. May God help me to
deal faithfully and do my duty by all classes&mdash;to those in authority as
well as those in bondage. Now, understand me, I have no personal
grievances to bring to you. It is simply mismanagement and the
desire to run these prisons on as cheap a scale as possible, to save
money for the State and hold position; and something must be
done soon.</p>

<p>I told the men to be obedient and faithfully discharge their duty as
prisoners. In all my work in every state and territory, Europe,
Mexico and Canada, I have never had any trouble; and can go again
to all these prisons where I have held services. What object have
I? None, but the good of the souls and bodies of those in bonds.
They are my children, given me by the Lord, and I feel as much compassion
for them as you would for your child. All the officers and
people were kind to me and treated me with the utmost respect. All
I desire is that you obey God and cause this starving and brutal
treatment to cease. Please say nothing of this letter but investigate
for yourself and see if these things are not so. Two meals a day
(and very little then) for a sick man is not enough.</p>

</p>

<p>Dear Madam: Your letter of recent date addressed to Gov. &mdash;&mdash; was
referred to me. I regret exceedingly that you did not call at my
office on the occasion of your visit. While there is a great deal of
truth in your letter there is much that indicates that you were innocently
misled by statements of convicts. I know that you must
be a good woman, that your heart is in your work, and from your
wide experience, amply capable of advising and instructing one
like me. In undertaking the task of uniting to bring our prison
systems in this state to a humane basis, we have done more than
you can understand. Had you been familiar with the conditions during
the past thirty years under the lease system you would realize that
much has been accomplished even in the short time we have been
at work. I realize that more is yet to be done. But "Rome was not
built in a day." The public has got to be educated as well as
individuals in immediate charge. I hope therefore you will be patient,
and will be only too glad to see and confer with you should you
again visit us here. In the meantime I beseech your earnest sympathy
and prayers for proper guidance in our work, for I assure you
that it is one that requires such moral support as only such as you
can fully understand and appreciate. With great respect, I am,</p>

<h4>PLEA FOR WOMEN CONVICTS.</h4>

<p>In some instances women are made to do the farm work,
work in brick yards, and to do other kinds of hard work.
At one place in the south the women cultivated a thousand
acres of cotton, doing other farming and caring for the
stockade, horses, mules, cows and hogs and having only
men to guard them. They were not allowed a woman
matron to care for them when they were sick or dying. I
found them in rags and tatters and looking almost like wild
beasts. I went to the governor of that state and pleaded
with him for my own sex. I begged him to protect the
poor women from such cruel treatment and brutal punishment.
I asked him to have them taken in from the farm,
where they were clearing up the land and compelled to
carry logs, to the state prison at the Capitol which was nearly
empty, and given proper work and humane treatment.</p>

<span class="caption">WOMAN CONVICT AT WORK.</span>
</div>

<p>Once upon my knees before a governor I begged him to
take the women from the stockades to the prison walls at
the capital, and place them under the care of a good matron
and give them such work as women should do. Also that
they be properly clothed and fed and taught morals and
religion. I said, "For the sake of young men which you
now employ to control and guard these women, won't you
do this?" (I had found several young babes, born in this
place.) He promised that he would see that this was done.</p>

<p>But a year later I found these women still in the fields
laboring and suffering as before. I again went to the governor.
He was now so changed I hardly knew him. I said
to him, "Well, governor, I see the affairs of state wear
heavily upon you. You look ten years older than you did
a year ago when I was here. Why did you not fulfill your
promise to me about transferring those women from the
stockades to the prison here at the capital? I promised that
I would not make public the condition in which I found
them if you would look after them. You promised to have
them treated better, but it is just the same now." He was
surprised at my knowledge of affairs and my firmness and
tried to excuse himself, and said that he had brought some
of them away to the prison.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion in later years, in a place I had visited
for some years, I found that an old colored woman had been
tied to a log and severely whipped on the bare flesh. The
other women could not bear to see her so cruelly treated,
and silently cried unto God to take the cruel captain who
had ordered her so punished out of the way. He did so;
for when I arrived there in a few days he was struck with
death and soon died. God did not allow him to compel the
whipping of any more women.</p>

<p>I think that upon only one occasion was I ever treated
other than kindly and with respect by any governor. In
this case I insisted that the women prisoners, especially,
should be more humanely treated. The governor refused
to take any action regarding the cruelties practiced but
said, "Go to the Principal Keeper." I replied, "I have just
come from the Principal Keeper and he sent me to you,
Governor. These captains are not permitted to strike one
blow without a license from you. It is by your permission
that they whip and punish them." He was evidently annoyed
to think that I so well understood the condition of
the prisons and their management. It was now election
time and he was running for office for another term, and he
dismissed me without further ado. Many like him are saying:
"Am I my brother's keeper?" Yes, you and I dear
reader, and those in authority will surely have to answer in
the great day of reckoning, if we neglect to alleviate the
sufferings of our fellowmen, when it is in our power to do
so. There are many kind men in office who really desire
better conditions of affairs, but are only servants of those
who are higher in authority. Truly the penalty for crime
must be paid, but give all a chance to reform and do right
before God and man. Can we not let poor fallen human
beings see that we do care for them? And that there is
hope in Christ for them if they will repent and confess
their sin to Him? Did He not come "to seek and to save
that which was lost?"</p>


<h4>BLOOD HOUNDS.</h4>

<p>I never will forget my feelings when first the howls of
the bloodhounds sounded in my ears. I was in a stockade
and there was a noise such as I never heard before. I was
on my knees praying and the wife of the captain came in
saying, "There has been an escape and the guards and
dogs are after the convict." I just lifted my heart to the
Lord in prayer for the poor unfortunate, hunted man. I
never stopped to think whether white or black; old or
young; innocent or guilty; my one cry was for the life and
safety of my boy.</p>

<p>Mothers you know how you would feel were it your boy.
Well, I got initiated in that part of prison management
that day. I have one thought above all others and that is
to do God's will and obey Him and help all in anyway I can
into a good life here and a home in Heaven at last; poor
heart-sick, home-sick and sin-sick souls. The very thought
of the convict being helpless should appeal to our sympathy
and God, the Judge of all the universe, is going to call us
to give an account for our stewardship. Men and women
must be governed but not by brute force. We may overpower
them, but do we conquer them? Have we won them
to a better life and to good citizenship?</p>

<span class="caption">CONVICTS GETTING OUT COAL.</span>
</div>


<h4>COAL MINES.</h4>

<p>The prison stockades vary in number. Sometimes there
may be thirty or forty in one state, sometimes probably not
half that many. It depends
upon the number
of prisoners in the penitentiary
and into how
many sections they are
divided. When I was at
Coal City, Ga., a number
of years ago, it was one
of the most weird and
desolate-looking places
in which I had ever
found a stockade located.
There were three stockades
on the summit of
the mountain, and one at
its base. At the last
place the men were mining
coal. When I first went there they used a
small car that would hold eight passengers. Then
this was abandoned and we were obliged to ride on the
engine, as they carried only coal cars for shipping the coal
that was mined by the prisoners. I was often in great danger
of my clothes taking fire as the fire blazed out of the
engine when the men were shoveling in the coal. The railroad
zig-zagged up the mountain, and once, a sister and
myself were obliged to ride on the coal-box, as the engine
was packed with men and one woman before we had arrived
from the other train. I had to kneel down and hold
onto the side of the coal box with both hands, and as the
engine twisted and turned, I was in danger of falling, and
it was hundreds of feet down to the foot of the precipices
in places where our train crept along. All the way up the
mountain I prayed God to protect us. The train was run
by prisoners, yet I always felt safe with them.</p>


<h4>A TOUCHING INCIDENT.</h4>

<p>"Lady, is you a preacher? Coz, if you is, I want you
to come over to my house 'long wid me and make a prayer,
coz my mother is dead, and my father is in prison over the
stockade wall, and they are goin' to bury my mother, and
there ain't nobody to make a prayer, 'cept a colored woman
who was kind to my mother and loved her coz she was
good. We children ain't got nobody to care for us."</p>

<p>It was just as I was leaving the railroad station near the
Pratt Mine prison stockade in Alabama that I was accosted
as above. The speaker was a small white boy with
hands and face so black with coal dust that one could
hardly tell that he was white. The sadness of that child's
voice touched my heart, and I said, "Yes, surely I will be
glad to go with you, my child."</p>

<p>Through the mountain forest the little boy had come in
search of some one to make a prayer over the dead mother
who, while she was living, had taught her children about
Jesus. I found the cabin by his guiding me along the
mountain path through the underbrush. Such a sight as
met my eyes! A body covered with a ragged sheet, lying
on a board held up by a couple of rickety stools. Nothing
was in the hut to make it look like home. Two old crones
sat by the stump fire in the large fireplace, making free use
of snuff and tobacco. It was a dirty little one-roomed cabin.
The funeral was to be at once, but the man who was
making the rough box which was to serve as a coffin was
so slow that we finally waited for the funeral till the next
day.</p>

<p>I went to the prison camp and found the husband and
father of the little boy, and obtained permission of the officials
for him to attend the funeral of his wife, providing
that I should be responsible for his return. Well, God understood
it all and helped me there in that wild country;
for that was when the prison stockades were not what
they are today. Conditions are much changed since I first
went with a gospel message to those lonely prisoners and
sin-bound souls.</p>


<h4>MY FIRST MEETING IN A PRISON CAMP.</h4>

<p>That night I held my first service in a prison camp. The
captain was loth to allow me the privilege, but the Lord
touched his heart and he said that I might try. I had come
a long distance on the train and had taken little to eat for
several days for those were days of much fasting and
prayer. The call of God was upon me. I must preach the
Gospel to these men. So now, I had but one thing to do,
to wait alone upon the Lord. I knelt before God in the
little old wooden hut used as an office, and cried to the
Lord, "O Lord, help me! O Lord, help me! Show me
how to hold a meeting here!" Just after dark a guard
came and said, "We are ready for the meeting to begin.
Come on." Imagine how I felt when there alone before
hundreds of men in rags and tatters, with hands and faces
so black and grimy with coal dust (this being in a prison
mining camp) that I could scarcely tell the white men
from the colored! The building was low and dirty, the
men were seated on rude benches, the guards standing with
their guns in hand and many great strong bloodhounds by
their sides. The room was dimly lighted by three smoky
old lanterns hanging on the walls. I had conducted prayer
meetings in the church, led in temperance meetings, and
labored with church people in the cities, and had been a
Sabbath school teacher for years; but I had never before
faced a congregation such as I now saw before me. I
knelt in silent prayer before stepping upon the rough old
box upon which I was to stand while I spoke. I arose and
sang an old-time hymn, and again knelt and offered prayer.
I told God all about why I was there. I sang another
hymn, but could go no farther. All eyes were fixed upon
me, and I asked, "Is there one Christian here? If so please
raise your hand." I stood trembling and thought, "Must I
stand all alone here with no one to pray for me, or encourage
me in my labor for the Master?" At last one old colored
man timidly raised his hand, followed by another, and
then another. How I thank God even now for this&mdash;after
all these years of toil as a prison worker. Then, I was
soon lost in the theme of Jesus and His love. I seemed to
see those rough prison miners as dear children once more
in the old home at mother's knee at night-fall listening to
her "Now I lay me down to sleep." As I closed, seeing
that the Lord had spoken to many hearts by His Holy
Spirit, I asked who would kneel with me in prayer and begin
a new life. I think every prisoner bowed there before
God with the heavy prisoners' chains clanking as only such
can do. The sound is inexpressibly sad to me even now
after so many years of labor in prisons and the rattling of
the great keys in the hand of the guard and the sound of
the heavy iron doors as they open and close, receiving
"some mother's boy," are still as affecting to me as in those
early days of my prison work.</p>

<p>Many of these men on that night in humility and meekness
sought and confessed Christ as their Savior. I know
not how many who knelt with me there, I shall meet in
heaven; but I know that God has said His Word shall not
return unto Him void. "He that goeth forth and weepeth,
bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,
bringing his sheaves with him."</p>

<p>At the close of the service an officer informed me that
his wife had prepared to entertain me. I gladly accepted
of the kind offer and went to their humble home, greatly
enjoying their hospitality, for I was much exhausted and
very weary with the long journey, the anxiety and the
labor of the day. These remained my faithful friends
while I knew them. I thank God for those who open their
homes to the children of the Lord.</p>

<p>The next morning the lady said, "I will let my little girl
go with you to the funeral and to show you the way through
the mountains to visit the sick." So I went again to the
miserable home of the poor little ones who were left worse
than orphans. How my heart was filled with sorrow, seeing
the lonely helpless children, two boys and a beautiful
little girl, with mother dead, and father in prison! I wondered
what their future might be. A few mountaineers'
wives had assembled, but there were not enough men present
to lift the box that contained the corpse into the old
coal wagon. After the short, sad services, with my assistance
as a pall bearer the crude coffin was lifted into the
wagon, and I helped to steady it as we traveled over the
rough mountain road to the cemetery. I had double duty
caring for this and making sure that the husband and father
did not attempt to escape; for you know liberty is sweet.
The Lord of hosts must have kept him true to his promise,
and I must say that I can always trust the poor prisoners
not to betray the confidence I place in them. At the
grave I sang the old hymn. "I would not live always" and
we laid the faithful wife and mother away to rest until the
trumpet shall call the dead to rise.</p>

<p>What was the cause of the sad plight of this family?
Sin. The saloon! There had been a saloon fight, and some
one was killed. Some one did the deed. Oh, God! What
a reckoning there will be in the end for those who vote to
license the saloon, as well as they who dispense the rum,
God will open the books and all shall be judged out of the
things that are written therein. "Vengeance is mine, I
will repay, saith the Lord of hosts." This faithful wife and
mother had spent all her living in an attempt to secure the
liberty of her husband. But failing in this, she had come
with her children to live in that dreary place, hoping to be
able to lead him to a better life, finally dying in want, and
of a broken heart. After the funeral I pleaded with the little
girl to go with me. But she true to her trust, true to her
dead mother's loyalty, said, "Never will I leave my poor
father with no one to care for him. Mother never would,
I never will. I will go to see him and tell him of Jesus."</p>

<p>Wearied with toil and the journeying from place to
place to visit the sick to whom the little girl from the camp
had guided me, I returned in the evening with her to her
home and then to the camp. Thinking to lie down and take
some rest, and kneeling to pray, I was impressed that I
must visit the other stockade some two or three miles away.
I knew it was the voice of God and said, "Yes." The lady
strongly pleading that I must not go, that it was dangerous,
said I could not go alone, that I would lose my way, etc.
The husband also said one's life was in danger, that several
men were found dead in those mountains and no one knew
who killed them, etc., and pleaded with me not to go. But
I said, "If God sends me, He will see that I am not harmed.
He will not forsake me." Soon I started on my way, and
presently met the two little boys whose mother had just
been buried. I asked if one of them would not show me
the way to the other camp, and the older one kindly did so.
With my little guide we hurried down that rough mountain
side, we being compelled to carry stones to build a
bridge across a stream of water, and finally came within
sight of the camp. Upon insisting that God had sent me,
and that I had held services in the other camp, the captain
(overseer) invited me into his home. I had not expected
such kindness, but thanking the Lord I accepted it as from
Him. They kindly brought us food, but I would not eat,
and gave it all to the little boy who was so hungry, and
praying for him he started homeward. Here also we had
a wonderful meeting. Men with broken hearts wept with
longing for a mother's sympathy and a Savior's love. Some
came to Christ and were saved, and I believe that I shall
meet some of them in the great home gathering bye and
bye in heaven.</p>

<p>Early the following morning, I was told that the engine
which was to take me on my way was ready to start with its
train of coal cars for the station some ten miles distant;
but that I would have time to visit the hospital department
where many were lying sick. I hurried through the prison
yard, filled with hogs and bloodhounds, to the hospital,
where I sang a song and prayed. I was turning to go
when a guard came running and said, "The whole train is
waiting for you, hurry up." As I was hurrying out a door
opened and a woman called, "Do come and see my son, he
is dying. Do come and pray for him." I ran in saying,
"The train may go; I dare not refuse the request." I
grasped the dying boy's hand firmly and said, "Take hold
on God as I take hold of your hand. He will not forsake
you. He will save you; look and live." I offered a short
prayer and ran down to the engine, which still waited.
There was something seeming so dismal in its sound in
those lonely regions. I had to ride on the engine, as
there was nothing but coal flats on this train. I was helped
on and we were off. The sun was just rising over the
mountain and the heavy fog was beginning to rise, and oh,
such a blessing I received as we sped along the winding
way! I shall never forget the gloomy sight I left behind
me there. The poor prison-bound men marching out to
the mines with their lanterns on their caps and with their
picks and shovels. They never seemed so dear to me, and
I began to see more clearly than ever that God had a special
work for me to do. I saw the value of a soul bought
with the precious blood of Christ. I saw, too, the need of
fully consecrated Christian workers. As we wound around
the mountain side I knew I had been obedient to my God,
and His Spirit bore witness with my spirit that He accepted
my weak efforts.</p>


<h4>DIFFICULTIES OVERCOME.</h4>

<p>I was not always kindly received as mentioned in some
instances. We are not carried to heaven upon flowery
beds of ease. I have many times been refused the privilege
even of singing a hymn in a prison. My singing has often
been blessed as a means of touching hearts, and through it
souls have been converted and are still true to God. I went
to visit another prison mining camp or stockade, in a very
lonely region where few people lived. I arrived upon a
dark, gloomy night; there was no depot and not a house
near. There I was alone, yet not alone, for God was with
me. A young mulatto man who proved to be an ex-convict,
had come to the train with a lantern, and I asked him
to kindly show me the way to the home of the captain of
the camp. I found the officer had gone in search of a prisoner
who had made his escape, and his wife refused to
take any one in in her husband's absence. She said I
should go to another officer some distance away. Ascending
the steps to the large house my heart sank within me,
for I felt that I should be turned away again in the night.
The officer himself came to the door to answer my call.
Telling him my mission, I asked to stay with them till
morning. His wife would not consent to entertain me, and
I answered, "Where shall I go? I am alone, and a Christian
woman sent of God to help people in prison to a better
life." He replied, "There's a boarding house a mile away
down the mountain," and the door was shut. I asked my
guide, "Is there not one Christian here in these mountains?"
He said, "Only one, a poor old colored man, that's been in
prison, and he lives up the mountain with his daughter, a
young woman." Crying as I went along holding to the
brush with one hand, we finally reached the hut at the top
of the mountain. I told the young woman my story and
asked if I might stay with her for the night. She answered,
"No, my father is away and I cannot take in a
stranger without his consent." "Then I must stay out on
the mountain alone all night." She seemed sorry for me,
and said I should wait till her father came. I had not to
wait long till he came, and kindly consented for me to
stay. I was weary and hungry from my long journey. I
saw the old colored man open the basket he had brought
home with him. It contained some cold food given him
where he was employed. He asked me to share his lunch,
but I refused, as I believed he needed all he had.</p>

<p>How thankful I was for shelter in that poor hut that
night, though sleeping by my side was that poor unfortunate
colored girl with a babe in her arms that cried all the
night. There were cracks in the hut through which you
could see the stars. What a change the Lord had wrought
in the once proud woman that I had been! I remembered
that Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
head." And "The disciple is not above his master." I
spent the night in prayer and God heard my cries for the
poor convicts who were cruelly starved and beaten by the
drunken guards and captain who seemed to bitterly hate
all who were so helplessly bound under them. This is a
strong statement but I will meet it at the Judgment.</p>

<p>In the morning one woman who had turned me from her
door sent to find out what had become of me. She said
she would give the young woman who had sheltered me a
present for not leaving me out on the mountain alone. I
had prayed earnestly that God would convict her for her
lack of hospitality. Upon going to the officer to learn
when I could have a meeting with the prisoners, he unkindly
turned me away saying that I should <em>never</em> have a
meeting there, and that I might as well go.</p>

<p>Well, I did go; traveling eighty miles back to the capital,
Montgomery, Alabama, to see the Governor. I knew the
Lord had sent me, and how could I meet Him at the Judgment
and tell Him I had failed? I knew, too, that Satan
had hindered. I asked for the Governor but was told that the
President of the Board of Prison Inspectors was the proper
person for me to see about the matter. He was sent for
and soon came. He was a very kind old gentleman and
sat down and asked me what I wished. When I had related
the facts he said, "Who dare refuse you holding meetings
in that prison camp? You go back there and hold
your meeting. I'll write him a letter and let him hear
from me." I said, "But he will say he did not receive your
letter." He then said he would write a letter for me to
present to him. But, how should I get back to the camp?
After selling my trunk and such articles of clothing as I
could spare, I yet did not have enough money to pay railway
fare.</p>


<h4>MY FIRST FREE PASS.</h4>

<p>Trusting the Lord to in some way provide means for
me to get back to the camp, I went to the janitress of the
depot, an intelligent mulatto, and told her of my need, as
she had previously assisted me in securing half-fare rates
on the railroad, she having known the officials since their
childhood. She insisted that I should go to the office of
the general manager of the L. &amp; N. R. R. and ask for a
half-fare rate to the prison camp at New Castle, Ala. Oh,
how I dreaded to go to that office! But tremblingly and
prayerfully I went, and presenting to him the letter which
I was to carry with me to the camp, I told him my desires.
Upon reading this letter he handed me what I supposed
was a half-fare permit. I humbly thanked him and returned
to my lodging. After making preparation to start
early in the morning on my journey, before retiring for the
night I knelt by my bedside to thank God for the permit.
Thinking I would see just how it read before I prayed, I
took it up and began reading, "Pass Mrs. <em>Elizabeth R.
Wheaton</em> From <em>Montgomery</em> to <em>Birmingham, Ala., Prison,
Missionary</em>." What! Did my eyes deceive me, or was it a
mistake. No. It was a free pass, and the following note
was enclosed to the Superintendent at the other end of the
route regarding a return pass if I should ask for it:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">

<p>Oh, how I did thank God for this manifestation of His
goodness to me&mdash;doing above that which I could ask or
think! Mr. Belknap, that kind R. R. officer, has been dead
many years, and perhaps is forgotten by some who knew
him better than I, but I shall never forget his unexpected
kindness to me. Since then, through the goodness of God
and the favor and confidence of the railroad officials, I have
received transportation throughout the country, to carry the
Gospel of Jesus to men and women of every class.</p>

<p>Upon my return to the prison camp I asked for the officer
and told him I had come to hold meeting for the prisoners.
I suppose he had received word from the Governor's
office, as he so readily consented, asking at what hour
I would like to have the service. I thought best to wait till
the following day (Sunday) for the services, that I might
have sufficient time for my work. The Lord came in
mighty power that Sabbath day as I sang the old time
hymns, and asked God to forgive and help those precious
souls. The Spirit gave me utterance and carried the truth
to the hearts of the hearers. Sobs and groans were heard
from men in tears who sought forgiveness and gave God
their hearts. At the close I took each one by the hand and
exhorted them to be faithful to God. I afterwards visited
the sick and talked and prayed with them, exhorting them
to seek a home in heaven where sin can never come, and
where God wipes away all tears. How true the words,</p>

<p>One Sunday morning I was going to a prison camp to
hold meeting. There was no way to get there excepting to
walk through the deep mud. There were a couple of boys
going towards the stockade leading an old mule. I said,
"O, boys, <small>CAN'T I RIDE THAT MULE</small>?" "Certainly," they
said. It was with difficulty that I mounted the novel conveyance,
and that I remained on the mule's back. For
some reason, I was filled with apprehension. I had an impression
that there was danger. I asked the boys if they
would not lead the animal, but they kept a good distance
from it, saying that they wanted to keep out of the mud.</p>

<p>When we reached the camp and the officers came out and
helped me to dismount, they looked at me in great astonishment,
and one of them said, "What a narrow escape you
have made! I only wonder that you got here alive. It is
a wonder that old mule didn't kill you. I wonder that the
boys let you take it!" I learned that the animal was so
utterly uncontrollable and vicious that they could only use
him on a dump cart to carry the prisoners' dinner or something
of the sort and then he would sometimes kick the
cart all to pieces.</p>

<p>I raised my heart in thanksgiving to God, knowing that
He who stopped the lion's mouth and held the flames of
the fiery furnace had in some way kept this ugly creature
from doing me any harm and saved my life.</p>

<h3>Work in Stockades and Prison Camps&mdash;Continued.</h3>


<p>I once had a novel experience in a prison lumber camp.
I was being entertained at the home of the superintendent
of the camp and was to hold service with the prisoners at
twilight. The superintendent came to the parlor and asked
if I was ready for the service. We had not far to go, but
I was unable to walk the distance; so a carriage, drawn
by some of the prisoners, had been brought to the gate for
me. I answered that I was ready, but as I was waiting he
again asked if I was ready and why I was waiting. I replied
that I was waiting for the horses. He answered,
"You come on, the horses will be all right." I had learned
to obey the officers, so followed on down through the beautiful
yard of flowers and reluctantly stepped into the carriage.
Instantly four prisoners took hold of the carriage
and we were off. The men seemed glad to assist me and
I was so thankful to them. God bless them! I do not
think a queen with all her body-guard could have felt more
secure or have been more appreciated, than I, there surrounded
by my dear prison boys. After the service I was
conveyed in the same manner back to the home of the
superintendent.</p>

<p>At another time, desiring to visit a certain prison camp,
I found there was no way to reach it but to ride on a flat
car with the men going from their work. I was glad to go
with them and have a chance to speak a word of kindness
and sing some hymns that might cheer them on the way.</p>

<p>In the pineries of Florida the stockade prisoners are
engaged in taking the sap from the pine trees. The camps
are located some miles apart, and in going from one to another
the forests are so dense that we were compelled to
go in a two-wheeled donkey-cart. We encountered great
dangers, there being many poisonous reptiles and alligators
in the lakes and rivers which we had to pass.</p>


<h4>ASSISTING A COLORED MINISTER.</h4>

<p>I arrived one Sunday morning at a stockade where hundreds
of men and some women were kept. I went to the
keeper, or captain, as he was called, and asked for the privilege
of holding a gospel service with the prisoners under
his charge. He not only refused me, but was abusive, cursing
me and ordering me away. Of course I was much
grieved, as I felt the Lord had sent me there to preach the
gospel. I was greatly surprised that an official should use
such language to a lady, and without provocation. Weeping,
I asked if I might sing for the women prisoners.
Again, with oaths, he refused me. But Brother Frank
Joseph, a colored preacher who knew me, was there to
hold religious services by permission of the governor, and
he came and invited me to assist him. Of course the captain
could say nothing against it and I went with him. But
when he asked me to conduct the service I could not at the
first sing, preach or pray for weeping, but I told him I
would pray God to give them a kinder officer for I knew
the one they had was a cruel man. God used even my
weakness and my tears to touch their hearts and we had a
blessed meeting.</p>

<p>After service I had a chance to talk to the women prisoners.
We wept together and oh how thankful they were
that there was one woman who would try to help them and
make their burdens lighter. They told me how terribly
they were treated and said they would be beaten if the captain
knew of their telling me of it. How glad I was to
carry the message of Jesus' love to them in their distress.
Before I left they said they wished they had something to
give me, and some gave small tokens of their regards. It
was all they had to give and when they urged me I accepted
them as from the Lord, feeling that He would in some
way reward them and bless their offering as He did the
widow's mite.</p>


<h4>THROUGH DANGER ALONE.</h4>

<p>Desiring to reach another stockade some miles distant I
asked the captain if he could not supply me with conveyance
and a guide, but he refused. I determined, however,
to find the other prison and started on foot alone. The
prison women told me that it was very dangerous because
of fierce dogs and cross cattle in the mountains; but feeling
that God wanted me to go I knew no such thing as fail.
After walking some distance I sank down with exhaustion
under a big tree and wept out my heart to God for guidance,
protection and success. I arose feeling strengthened
and comforted and soon came to a farm house and asked a
young man who stood in the garden if he could direct me
to the prison camp. "Yes, come in, lady, you look so tired
and faint and my mother will give you something to eat
and we will show you the way," was the kind reply I received.
I stopped and rested a while but would neither eat
nor drink as I had given myself to fasting and prayer that
my way might be opened for services in the camp to which
I was going. After a long walk we found the stockade and
knowing the young man who was with me, the officers gave
their consent for me to hold a service. After I had been
singing and talking to the prisoners a while suddenly my
strength failed me. I had only time to say, "Will you
sing?" Then I saw and heard nothing more. I <small>HAD FALLEN
PROSTRATE</small> among those chained prisoners. When I
came to myself I heard singing from inside the walls, such
singing as could only come from truly broken-hearted, repentant
souls. I had been carried outside and the poor
prison women were caring for me. A good old colored
sister was holding me close to her and pleading with God
to restore me. I heard her say, "She's a woman like we
is&mdash;and she's given her life for us." They were doing all
they knew and were crying around me. I said, "Please
carry me back into the prison." When they had done so I
asked, "How many of you prisoners will kneel with me in
prayer and give your hearts to God, take Him as your
Savior and start today for heaven? God loves you, Jesus
died for you! And if you will come to Him and confess
your sins He will save you." Every one knelt before God,
and many with prayers and broken sobs cried out their
hearts to Him who is not willing that any should perish,
but that all should have eternal life. I expect to meet many
of them in heaven; for He is able to save to the uttermost
all that will come unto God by Him&mdash;and able also to keep
them from falling.</p>

<p>The following day, traveling from this prison to another
stockade, sitting near me in the car was an aged gentleman
who on seeing my Bible asked me where I was going.
When I had told him, he asked me the nature of my work
and how the prisoners were treated in these places; also
how I was received by the officials of the prisons generally.
Thinking to only entertain a kind old country gentleman,
I told him many things which I probably should
not have been so free to mention had I known who he was.
He asked me many questions about the stockades. I told
him that I had never been so cruelly treated as at a camp on
the previous day. "Where," he inquired, "Who did such
a thing?" In answer to his inquiry I told him who it was.
Little did I know that this was God's way of revealing sin.</p>


<h4>A MEETING AT DAY DAWN.</h4>

<p>Reaching the small station at the foot of the mountain;
we had to take a box car only large enough for six persons.
The old gentleman was one of the passengers also. Going
to the house of the captain at the top of the mountain
(such a lonely place), he thought it impossible to have a
meeting with the men, as he said they were so wicked and
unruly, etc., but finally said I might do so at day-break the
next morning. He was very careful, saying, "These men
are so wicked and cruel that never could a woman stand
before them." I wept and prayed most of the night and
cried, "Oh God, can you let me fail now?" In those early
years of my labor I traveled much alone but later I usually
had a sister accompany me, or sometimes a sister and her
husband.</p>

<p>Out in the prison yard at break of day I found hundreds
of men all ready to go down into the coal mines. I wondered
how to gain their attention and make them all hear
my voice. I asked to have the men drawn closer together,
as they stood in the prison yard. This being done, I sang
a hymn. Oh how I do praise God for the gift of song! I
forgot my weird surroundings and the rough appearance
of the men and their dangerous looks. I saw them as little
boys in the old home far away and then as human souls,
hurrying into the presence of God and I felt that I stood
between them and the Judgment. Conceive, if you can,
how this company must have looked to me, bound in companies
of perhaps fifty in a "gang," to a long strong chain
to which was fastened a number of shorter chains; these
short chains being fastened to the men's ankles.</p>

<p>God enabled me to deliver His message and eternity
alone will reveal the results of the seed scattered there that
morning. After shaking hands with the men I was introduced
to the old gentleman whom I had met on the train
the day before. To my surprise he proved to be the President
of the Board of Prison Inspectors of the state. I saw
him no more after that time, but a year later I visited the
prison of which I had told him. I saw at the depot a young
colored man nicely dressed, but I knew by his clothes that
he was one of the prison boys. He had come to get the
morning paper for the warden. I walked with him to the
prison, and on the way asked him how they all were at the
camp. "All so nicely, thank you," he replied. "Who is
your captain now?" I asked. "Has there been any change
since I was here last year?" "O yes, ma'am, soon after
you was here ma'am, just as soon as Massa (meaning the
President of the Board) could find a good man to take de
place ob de ole captun what treated de men so bad and
'bused you so, he sent him away." "Oh, is that so?" I said.
"Yes, an' we's got a good time now to what we had befo'
God sent you heah ma'am. He certainly did send you heah
ma'am dat time." So I had only suffered these indignities
that these abused ones might have better officers and treatment.
The new captain received me very kindly and giving
me a seat said my breakfast would be ready as soon as
the prison women could prepare it for me. Well, surely
the Lord had been at work. Such a change all around!
We had a grand meeting and much good was accomplished,
the captain furnished a buggy to take me to the
next camp and bring me back to the depot.</p>


<h4>HELPING TO BURY A PRISONER.</h4>

<p>After visiting the hospital department of a stockade
where I had never been before, I saw the guards nailing
up a long, apparently heavy, box. I said to them, "What
have you in that box?" One replied, "A man&mdash;a dead
man." Soon after I heard an officer say to a guard, "Send
five prisoners to go with me to bury that box." I arose
from where I had been praying, and hurried out and asked
permission to accompany the men with the box, but was
refused&mdash;the officer saying they had no guard to spare to
assist me up the mountain side. "Oh, just please let me
go," I said. "I do not need any one to help me to climb
the mountain. Please, won't you let me go?" He then
consented, and I did not wait for either bonnet or help;
but with my shawl over my head I hurried out after the
men bearing the corpse. On we went up the mountain
side, until we came to a very steep place, and the poor weak
prisoners began to tremble under the heavy burden, along
in front of the guard who had his gun in hand. I knew
if one should fall, the guard might suppose he was trying
to escape from him, and fire at him and kill him.</p>

<p>I took up a stick in my left hand to steady myself and
placing my right arm under the end of the box added my
strength to that of the tired men. When we reached the
summit of the mountain we found the grave already dug,
but it was much too short for the box. I was almost exhausted
and came near falling. The grave being too short,
they were going to leave the corpse until morning and then
return and bury it. But I said, "Boys, you dig the grave
longer and I will sing for you while you work." I sang
an old time hymn, and they lowered the box, by pounding
and jumping upon it and then hurriedly shoveled in the
dirt. Then I said, "Let us pray." And there in that dreary
place I prayed for the poor men who had performed this
sad rite and for the guard. I forgot my surroundings. I
thought only of "<small>SOME MOTHER'S BOY</small>," who perhaps died
with a broken heart without a mother's care, now lying in
an unknown grave far away from home. Perhaps she had
prayed for him and God had sent me to pray over the lonely
grave. There we left him where all his mistakes should
be forgotten. He may have sought and found pardon in
God. Who can tell? The stars were now shining and the
stillness filled me with awe. The men hurried down the
mountain side to the prison, leaving me behind in the dim
starlight. I found my way to the stockade, but found the
door locked and with great difficulty I made them hear me
and was admitted. At about nine o'clock the prisoners
were brought together to have a meeting. The guard ridiculed.
The prisoners wondered at seeing a woman preaching.
How I trembled! Oh, for some one to share my
burden! I asked, "Is there one Christian here among you
prisoners?" as I shook hands with them and some of them
pointing out an old colored woman, said, "She's a Christian."
I clasped her hand, hardened by work, and said,
"Will you pray for me, sister?" "Yes," she said, "Yes, I
will, honey."</p>

<p>God was there to touch and tender those hearts. They
were unused to meetings of this character, and perhaps
had never heard of a woman preaching. I well knew that
unless God undertook for me the meeting would be a failure.
There seemed to be no way to reach these hard
hearts. The men and women stared at me. Suddenly I
thought of the great danger I was in, and the risk I had
to run in getting back to the village that night. I saw the
head of a young prison boy droop over on a man's shoulder,
too sleepy to listen longer. Then I heard and saw no
more, but fell unconscious to the floor. The weariness
from the day's labor proved too much for my strength.
But God used my weakness to reach these hearts and when
I regained consciousness, men and women with tears, sobs
and prayers, were crying to God for mercy and forgiveness&mdash;pleading
for help to be better men and women. I
hope I shall meet many of them in heaven "when the roll
is called up yonder" for they truly seemed to bring forth
fruit meet for repentance.</p>

<p>The following day was spent among the sick and dying
in the village. I had asked the privilege in the morning to
go with the train men to the prison pest house where the
sick prisoners were, but was refused by the train crew, some
of them ridiculing me and my work. I had only kindly
asked them the privilege, and then exhorted them to come
to Christ. I then told them I feared the next message
would be judgment from God. God bless the railroad men
if some of them do make mistakes! My heart goes out for
them as they are always in much danger. I make it a rule
of my life to always pray for every train on which I travel
with its crew and passengers. And hitherto God has been
my help. Bless His holy name!</p>


<h4>WRECK OF A COAL TRAIN.</h4>

<p>When I had returned to the boarding house in the evening
I lay down to rest. Many striking things occurred in
this place. As I lay resting, dishes were rattling and children
were crying in adjoining rooms, my room door leading
into the open hall was standing open, and in came a
drove of little pigs. I looked up to see what it was, and
one had walked up to the fireplace where was burning a
low fire, and stood warming its nose. But they soon grew
tired of indoor life and all quickly scampered out as they
had come in. They had seemed as much at home there as
myself. Amid this confusion I fell asleep. How long I
slept I do not know. I was awakened by heart-rending
cries from men and women. I sprang up and throwing a
shawl over my head, I ran out in the rain to see what I
could do to help, for I knew some one was in great agony.
What I saw I shall never forget. The coal train and its
crew that had gone out in the morning had come in. <span class="smcap">The
engine was ditched</span> in a terrible manner and men were
crushed in the wreck. Women were screaming as they ran
to see if their loved ones were among the victims. I met
the same men I had warned in the morning carrying on a
board the fireman badly cut and bruised. I said, "Men, I
gave you the warning this morning. You rejected my
counsel and I thought judgment would come, but I little
thought it would come so soon." They carried the wounded
man to an old baggage car. People were so excited
they did not know what to do. Here I was to learn a lesson
in surgery. I found an old pail and brought some
water. Some bystanders gave me their handkerchiefs and
I proceeded to wash the blood from the poor wounded head
and limb, which was much crushed, and helped the doctor
to bind up the wounds. Soon there came a call for help
from the scene of the disaster. A messenger came running,
saying, "Come quick! there is a man dying whom we
found under the engine." It was very dark, but I hurried
along through the mud and rain after the doctor to the
scene of suffering. They had carried him into the nearest
hut, and he was lying upon the floor unconscious. Kneeling
beside him I raised his head upon my hand. Consciousness
returned. I cried, "Jesus can save you even now; He
loves you. He will forgive you now, only believe on Him."
He replied, "I do believe He does save me just now."
Glory to God! He is a present help in time of need; a
friend that sticketh closer than a brother. Dear reader,
it is better to be saved before the crash comes. The man
was suffering terribly. The women, thinking they must do
something, had poured turpentine into the wounds thinking
it was camphor. We washed the wounds and I assisted
the physician in setting the broken limbs. God wonderfully
helped me there to practice what I preached, and
I found what it means to love my neighbor as myself.
These railroad men were my neighbors, and they were
suffering and in a dying condition. One of the poor men
cried piteously for his mother. I traveled on the train on
which one of the wounded men was taken to the city
where his mother lived and helped to care for him on the
way. We were delayed at that camp for two days. I will
never forget those days of service and suffering.</p>


<h4>THE SUGAR CAMPS.</h4>

<p>At one time, I went into the Sugar Refining Stockades
in Texas. Leaving the train, we had to walk a long distance
to the first camp. The superintendent was angry at
us for coming, and ordered us to go to the next camp. He
said there were women at the other stockade and that he
would not let us have any meeting, any way, with his men.
We asked him if he would please send a boy to carry our
luggage, and he refused, so we started on alone, to walk a
long way. When we arrived at the second camp we found
only one guard and a couple of prisoners working, and no
women within miles. When the guard saw the situation,
he seemed sorry for us, and we were allowed to rest and
wait until the return of the prisoners, who were at work
at a distance on railroad repairs. In the meantime he sent
a man to another stockade some miles away, and the captain's
wife there agreed to entertain us, for which we were
thankful. We had a meeting after the men came to camp,
and the guards came to us and said that the women at the
camp mentioned before had sent word that they would not
keep us over night. What <em>could</em> we do? Finally I said,
"Can you take us to the depot?" They answered that they
had no conveyance but <small>AN OLD MULE AND A CART</small>. I said,
"That is all right." So they got the mule and cart and helped
us in, and handed us our luggage. Then they sent a colored
boy to go before the mule with a lantern, and another
followed after. In this way we went on until we reached
the little country depot, which was all dark. One of the
prisoners, who went with us, lighted the lantern inside,
and we called to the ticket agent, who had retired, asking
him to please check our luggage to San Antonio. This
he refused to do, so I said, "We are Christian women and
will give you almost any price, if your wife will allow us
to stay with her until morning." He was angry, still refusing
to get up to check our luggage. He said he was not
paid for night work. We could not have gotten on the
car had it not been for a gentleman, going on the same
train, who had his servant help us. We went to San Antonio
before we could get a place to rest and it was then
morning, but God blessed us in holding services in the prison
there that day. I never reported the agent who was so
rude to us, as I was sorry for him, for I was told he was
a cripple, and I thought he needed his work to provide for
his family.</p>


<h4>IN A GAMBLING SALOON.</h4>

<p>From Knoxville, Tenn., I went one night to the coal
mine region. I asked the landlord at the hotel for some
one to show me a way to the stockade some distance, and
he sent his chore boy with me. We had a long walk, and
returned after meeting at night. It was late and as we
came down the mountain side I saw a light at a little distance,
and I said, "Where is that light?" He said, "That
is the wickedest place; they kill people there." Without
waiting to consider the danger I might be in, I said, "Wait
here for me," and I hastened up the valley and into the
place, which I found to be a gambling saloon. Then, without
waiting, I poured out to them the Gospel message
which burned in my heart, I fell on my knees and prayed
to God to save them from the destruction to which they
were going. Then I rushed out into the darkness again,
and found the boy waiting with the lantern and we went
on our way. I was thoroughly alarmed next day when I
realized the risk I had taken in going into such a place, but
God has wrought mightily for me all these years and preserved
me from harm. As I write I feel near home and
heaven. Jesus is there. Soon I shall be with Him.</p>


<h4>CONDITION OF CONVICTS.</h4>

<p>I wish that some who whine so much in church about
taking up the cross could see the inside of those stockades
as I saw them&mdash;see the suffering that existed, the sorrowful,
heart-broken prisoners with no ray of hope, no one to
care about them; everything poor, scarcely enough to keep
them alive; the poorest of places to sleep; men fastened to
a large post in the middle of the stockade by a heavy chain,
compelled to wear their clothing till it would decay on
them, often so ragged that they could not hide their nakedness,
and guarded by bloodhounds and armed men. It was
not proper under other circumstances for a woman to see
men in such conditions, but they had souls to be saved or
lost, and the Lord had commissioned me to go to these men
and tell them that Jesus loved them and wanted to save and
deliver them from the power of the devil who got them into
such places.</p>


<h4>UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED.</h4>

<p>Judges often sentence men and women to years of hard
labor in prison for the slightest offenses. An old colored
man employed in a store took a box of cigars, but regretting
the act, returned them confessing his wrong, and
asked forgiveness. He was arrested and sentenced to
twenty-five years in the stockade; one year for each cigar.
Another colored man was found on the street at night
carrying five ears of corn. He was sentenced to prison for
five years. He with others was working where the earth
caved in and killed him. Who will answer in the day of
Judgment for that man's life and death? Yes, and his soul?
Were I to here relate some things I know to be true, awful
in the extreme, they would not be believed. Let us have
the laws of God enforced. Let those who may be anxious
to punish wrong and have men condemned upon circumstantial
evidence, look into their own hearts and lives and
see if they have been free from condemnation. I do not
want to condemn judges nor jurymen, for they are not all
to blame. A man or woman should never be condemned
until known to be guilty. People are often prejudiced, and
without proper investigation many are condemned to punishment
for crimes of which they are innocent. The cries
of such are come up before the Lord and He will hear and
answer prayer. At one time there were forty stockades in
one state and about four thousand prisoners in one state.
Let us help those that are down.</p>

<p>In many stockades I found men and women living together
promiscuously and children being born in the camp.
The poor creatures were subjected to all kinds of abuse
and suffering, the women in great need of better quarters,
better food, and care. Ofttimes they were afraid for their
very lives. Many were killed outright; in one place where
they were far out in the coal mines many were brutally
whipped and ill-treated. I went to the Lord in prayer, and
then to the state authorities and the Governor went out
with men and opened the graves of many, who had died in
camps. One of the officers was imprisoned for ten years;
another made his escape; others were dealt with more or
less severely. I had been out there myself, getting on the
engine to ride out to the stockade, and requested to see the
prisoners after their day's work was done, and as they came
up from the mines they were so ragged that I was compelled
to turn my back as they passed. I got permission to
hold a Gospel meeting. After it was over, I requested the
captain to let one of his men take us to the next house, a
distance of a mile or more from the camp. When we
knocked asking permission to stay for the night, and telling
who we were, the woman of the house said, "You had better
go and preach to those prison guards, who are killing
off the poor prisoners." She said she could not stand it to
hear such awful cries as reached her ears even at that distance
from the stockade. She told the guard just what she
thought of the brutality shown the prisoners and convicts.
He said he was not to blame. He seemed to be a kind
young man.</p>

<p>In one place I found one old colored man who was condemned
to death. He was filthy and dirty and had nothing
to lie on but a heap of straw; he was hungry and his cell
was dark and damp. My heart ached to see him so shamefully
abused. Even condemned men have rights and they
should be respected; it is enough for them to know that
they are to die a horrible death, without having all kinds
of abuse heaped upon them; yet I have seen this in many
prisons. How is it that friends are so often denied the
privilege of seeing those that are under death sentence or
those who are sick and dying? Let the truth be told and
let there be some one to investigate these things. I believe
that those who are most against prisoners, are those who
are not familiar with the conditions. Let good discipline
be maintained, but let prisoners never be brutally treated,
simply because they are powerless to help themselves. I
find many things going on that are not right, but I have
never made complaint to the governors of the states, unless
compelled to do so, because of cases of extreme cruelty.</p>


<h4>NEED OF REFORM.</h4>

<p>There is great need of reformation in the management
of prisons, and especially in the prison lease system and
management of women prisoners in the south. Oh, the
shocking sights that have greeted me on almost every
hand! There is nothing more heart-rending to me than
the terrible, brutal treatment of helpless humanity. These
prisoners are entirely at the mercy of officers who are oftentimes
void of feeling, coarse and vulgar in the extreme.
To get positions and make money is the aim of many of
today. The poor unfortunates shut up in prisons and
asylums are in many cases most shamefully mistreated.
They are supposed to be there for the purpose of reformation
or treatment, but were it not for the grace of God in
my soul, I never could endure the torture and anguish resulting
from the sufferings I find among these poor helpless
men and women. I am not supposed to know the conditions
in these places, but twenty years of experience going
inside these walls have opened my eyes and I get behind
the scenes. There is a time of settling up of accounts and
there will be a final reckoning day at the judgment bar of
God, for what was done in this life, and how many will be
weighed in the balance and found wanting!</p>

<p>The following paper by Clarissa Olds Keeler was written
to Brother S. B. Shaw and read at the meeting of the
National Convocation for Prayer at St. Louis, Mo., May,
1903, and will serve to convey some idea of conditions as
they have existed in some parts of our land; though we
are glad to say that they are somewhat improved, in many
places at least.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">"LET THE SIGHING OF THE PRISONER COME BEFORE
THEE."</p>

<p>"Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
prayer that is made in this place."&mdash;2 Chron. 7:15.</p>

<p>When attending the Christian Workers' Convention in New York
in 1887 a man from Tennessee also attending the convention, said to
me, "I wonder the Christian people do not take up the work of
alleviating the sufferings of prisoners in the Southern States."
For years he had been an eye witness to treatment which he described
as "most atrocious," and the condition of the convicts, especially
those hired to contractors to work in coal mines, as one of "starvation,
fear and disgusting filth." Since these words were spoken to
me I have spared no pains to inform myself about this new and
most revolting form of slavery, and I can find no words more
applicable than these: "This is a people robbed and spoiled; they
are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses;
they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil and none saith,
Restore. Who among you will give ear to this? Who will hearken
and hear for the time to come?" (Isaiah 42:22, 23.)</p>

<p>Each one of the twelve convict leasing states has had its own
bloody record which has been written down in God's book. Influential
politicians, United States Senators from both north and south, members
of state legislatures, private citizens, heartless corporations, have
all shared in the money coined out of the bodies and blood of convicts
in our southern states.</p>

<p>But it is not my purpose now to go over the past. Wherever
the convict lease system has been introduced "Its presence has," as
a Georgian once said, "been marked by a trail of blood." The
accounts of this ghastly institution are too revolting to present.</p>

<p>But I want to call the attention of the Christian people to the
present condition of convicts, most of whom are colored, and many
of whom are guilty of but trifling offences and some of them none
at all.</p>

<p>A man in Buncome County, North Carolina, wrote to the <cite>Asheville
Gazette</cite>, under date of March 15, 1903: "Where are we at and
where is the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals that
they or the Christian world have never heard the cries from the poor
unfortunate prisoners in the buck and the ringing of the cruel
blood stained lash? I have seen white men beaten until their persons
were blue and blood oozing from the lash from the captain's hands
in the Buncome chain-gang. And negroes&mdash;there is no use talking."
These prisoners, the writer says, have been guilty of some misdemeanor
and being poor and unable to pay a fine are "sent to the
road prison and there the lash is administered on the naked back
contrary to the spirit of the constitution in abolishing imprisonment
for debt and the lash at the whipping-post."</p>

<p>Now I would suggest that a society be formed for the prevention
of cruelty to prisoners. While the good people are praying for the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit on other lands may they not forget
that we need a baptism of fire right here in our own land.</p>

<p>Our Saviour's last act of mercy and forgiving love was shown
toward a prisoner and shall we imitate His example, or shall we not?
His last command was: "Go ye into all the world and preach the
gospel to <em>every creature</em>." How many inmates of our prisons have
the gospel presented to them? When we all meet at the judgment, as
meet we must, how many will be there from the mining pits and
prison pens who can say truthfully, "No man cared for my soul!"
Neither do we care for the bodies of these unfortunates; and as
proof of this I will give you a few extracts from papers of recent
date.</p>

<p>When the National Conference of Charities and Corrections was
holding its session in Atlanta the first of the present month, some
of the delegates were invited to visit the city prison stockade where
misdemeanor convicts are housed at night. This was done "just for
the amusement of the delegates." Hear what Mr. Timothy Nicholson
of Indiana, a delegate, said about his visit to this "school of
crime." He says: "I found in one room one hundred and sixty
prisoners, white men and women, black men and women and even
children, both black and white, male and female, all mixed together
indiscriminately. I was surprised and shocked to find such a condition
of affairs in a civilized country. It is simply a shame and
disgrace to civilization." The delegates declared the place "inhuman
and degrading." Yet this does not fully represent the awful
pen picture that might be given of this class of prisoners in the
county chain gangs all over the state.</p>

<p>The following extracts are taken from an account given by an
Atlanta correspondent of the <cite>Washington Post</cite> written under date of
May 5, 1903. "Revelations made to the Ware County grand jury
in regard to the horrors of the Georgia convict camps reached
Governor Terrell today. Hon. E&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, one of the leading
members of the Georgia House of Representatives, is involved in the
findings of the grand jury.</p>

<p>"According to the report M&mdash;&mdash; and his brother operate an extensive
camp in Lowndes County. Witnesses before the grand jury
testified that in the M&mdash;&mdash; camp the brutalities are such that it is
revolting to describe them. For the slightest offence, it is alleged,
prisoners are stripped and chained and unmercifully lashed by the
whipping bosses. It is also alleged that the M&mdash;&mdash; brothers go
into counties adjoining Lowndes, pay the fines of misdemeanor
convicts, carry such convicts to their Ware County (convict) camp
and there keep them in serviture long after the term for which
the criminals were sentenced have expired.</p>

<p>"The grand jury claims that at least twenty citizens of Ware
County are held as slaves in M&mdash;&mdash;'s camp although their terms
expired over a year ago. There men are kept in stockade about which
armed guards march in order to prevent an escape, and men thus
illegally detained who escaped have been chased by bloodhounds and
recaptured."</p>

<p>Official reports show that this class of convicts are guilty of but
trifling offences and some are vagrants. (For further particulars
see <cite>Atlanta Journal</cite> May 5 and 11, 1903.)</p>

<p>The penitentiary convicts of Georgia are worked in coal mines and
are subject to the same treatment. An experienced penologist said
recently concerning convicts worked in the mines: "In the rooms of
the mines are perpetrated practices too horrible to mention. They
become the nesting places of a bestiality that in many cases lead the
liberated convict into that crime to punish which the mob, the rope
and the stake are ever ready." (See Atlanta Constitution, May 14,
1903.)</p>

<p>Under the heading "Convict Camp Horrors," the editor of the
Memphis, Tennessee, <cite>Commercial Appeal</cite> says in his paper, dated
April 11, 1903, concerning the facts recently brought out by the
legislative investigating committee: "The stories coming from Brushy
Mountain mines, with side lights from the state's convict system,
generally, furnish painful reading to the people of Tennessee. When
human beings who through fault or fortune's untowardness are condemned
to helpless and unresisting servitude and who are subjected
to torments and tortures, floggings and flaggellations which are merciful
only where they terminated in speedy death, humanity is outraged
and a sort of savagery in the public cries out for speedy
vengeance." Continuing the editor says:</p>

<p>"Convicts have been whipped to death. Convicts have been whipped
into physical helplessness. Convicts have been whipped sufficiently to
keep them in bed for months and injure them permanently. Torturing
them in the prison or in the mine recesses is a sin against high
heaven." These are some of the facts brought to light by the
prison investigating committee.</p>

<p>The average number of prisoners worked in the Brushy Mountain
mines is about seven hundred and fifty. These convicts, which form
but a part of the number of the state's convicts, and who were so
inhumanly treated, earned last year for the state, clear of all expenses,
the sum of one hundred and ninety-five thousand, seven
hundred dollars. (See Nashville American, March 30, 1903.)</p>

<p>Recent developments also show that many innocent men are kidnapped
and worked and treated as convicts; especially is this done
in Alabama. Women and children share the same fate. During
the recent investigation into the enforced slavery of negroes in
Alabama by the United States Secret Service, among the abuses
which were unearthed was the whipping to death of a negro woman.
"This woman accused of being rebellious was laid across a log and
given one hundred lashes. Still showing a rebellious spirit her hands
were tied, and the rope was thrown over the limb of a tree and
pulled up so as to make it barely possible for her feet to reach the
ground. The woman, it is said, died two days later." (See Washington
Times, May 29, 1903.)</p>

<p>The system of peonage slavery has been practiced for years in
Alabama and Georgia. One of the most successful plans practiced is
to bring a negro before a magistrate on a flimsy charge. As the
matter has been arranged beforehand, the negro is convicted, and
having no money to pay his fine, a white man offers to advance him
money provided the negro will make a labor contract with him for
the money and trouble he has taken to keep the negro out of jail.
He is taken away and begins what is usually a long term of cruel
servitude, frequently whipped unmercifully, and every moment
watched by armed guards ready to shoot him down at any attempt
to escape.</p>

<p>Among the evils which have grown out of the prison contract system,
the number of which is legion, is that of turning out men and
women, boys and girls, thoroughly educated in these schools of crime.
They are thrown upon the world homeless and friendless to poison
and destroy those with whom they come in contact. Many soon find
their way back into prison, and some end their lives upon the gallows.</p>

<p>We sometimes on a Sabbath morning hear the President of the
United States prayed for, but what minister ever prays for the poor
parish behind prison bars?</p>

<p>When the book is opened and we hear the words: "I was sick
and in prison, and ye visited me not," what are we going to answer?</p>

<p>For about four years at times Mrs. M. A. Perry, of
Washington, D C., traveled with me. In answer to my request
for a brief report of the work during that time I received
a lengthy letter, from which I extract the following:</p>

<p>
Dear Sister Wheaton:<br />
</p>

<p>I praise God for the privilege of adding a few words for
your book. May the blessing of God rest upon it. To the
readers I will say: I first met Mrs. Wheaton in Boston, in
February, 1893, in the home of H. L. Hastings, the well-known
publisher, where she was a guest. She had then
spent ten years in prison and other evangelistic work. I had
visited a jail and stationhouses, but never a penitentiary.
We first went to the Boston and Maine Railway office.
Sister Wheaton said: "You pray while I go and ask for
a pass to go to the Thomaston, Maine, prison." In about
ten minutes she returned with the desired transportation.
By the kindness of the railroad officials from ocean to ocean
they have helped to forward the work of God. Many
earnest prayers are offered by Mrs. Wheaton for these men.
We never boarded a train without asking our Heavenly
Father to bless the train men from the engineer to the
flagman. Many times we have spoken to conductors who
have said, "No one ever talks to railroad men about their
souls."</p>

<p>At Thomaston we had to wait until Sunday morning to
enter the prison. If ever the Lord Jesus Christ revealed
Himself in a prison chapel He was in the midst that Sabbath
day. While "Mother Wheaton" preached, I prayed
for her and the presence of the Holy Spirit was so manifest
that every man expressed a desire to serve God. The
result of that day's work for the Master will not be known
until we meet when Jesus will reward his servants.</p>

<p>We next went to the jail in Bangor, Maine, and God
blessed the work there in the salvation of souls. Then we
went to the prison in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and from
there to the Vermont State Prison at Windsor. But I cannot
tell about them all! But wherever we went I saw that
the prisoners, both men and women, greeted "Mother
Wheaton" with a heartfelt welcome.</p>

<p>We went to the prisons of New York state&mdash;to Auburn,
Sing Sing, the Troy jail and on to Buffalo. We visited
the penitentiaries in Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the
workhouses of Maryland and the District of Columbia. We
met in these places many precious souls whom the Lord
gave his life to redeem and many of them were Christians.
The blood of Jesus is all powerful to reach any man or
woman who will repent and forsake sin and believe in Him.
We have great reason to praise God for the power of the
Holy Spirit to reach the hardest hearts. But O, there are
behind the bars and "in the shadow of the walls" loving
and tender hearts. O, that professors of religion would
wake up to the fact that when Jesus, the King of Glory,
shall come He will say, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me."</p>

<p>May God by his presence and power reveal to the managers
of penal institutions in every land and nation that
Jesus Christ is the friend of sinners in every condition. I
believe the dear Lord Himself has put such love for
prisoners in the heart of our sister Wheaton that she is
willing to take a mother's place&mdash;no matter when she sees
them. In riding along on the trains sometimes we came
to prisoners (leased out to hard labor) in the most unexpected
places. We were soon off the train to look after
these men who were marched from the camp or stockade.</p>

<p>I must speak of some of the experiences we had in the
prisons, stockades and prison farms of the southern states.
We were, in most cases, courteously received and entertained
by the wardens and their families. God bless the
men who have done what they could! But O, how I have
been shocked at things we saw in these places, many of
which I cannot write. I wish I could give some idea of
how glad the poor manacled prisoners were to see their
white-haired "mother" come again. I believe the seed sown
shall not be lost.</p>

<p>The women on the farms are required to roll logs, clear
land and do all kinds of drudgery.</p>

<p>We went to the camps, the phosphate mines, saw-mills,
coal mines, and the turpentine camps. Sometimes we rode
for miles in wagons. I think Mother Wheaton never felt
that any place was too dangerous or too out of the way for
her to go in order to say a word of comfort and to encourage
hearts. We sometimes rode on the engine up the mountains
to camps where hundreds of prisoners were working.
We saw men with iron rings around their necks and a
chain and ball attached, some with chains around their
waists and running down to their ankles with a ring attached.</p>

<p>I want to speak especially of a visit to one of the state
farms where all the prisoners, with two exceptions, were
colored women.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the station there was no vehicle in
sight but a buggy and mule which a little boy was driving.
She asked him to take us to the women's prison, which he
kindly did. When we got there between seventy and eighty
women were at dinner, sitting on the ground under the
trees with their little tin pails which held boiled bacon and
cowpeas, with a piece of corn bread in their hands. They
had worked from sunrise. How they welcomed "Mother
Wheaton"! Many of them were in tears as she began to
sing. She asked how many of them had seen her before.
Many hands went up and they told where and when they
had seen her in the past. How they shook her hand and
said, "O, 'deed I is glad to see you once more, honey."
But soon they had to go back to the field till dark. After
all had their supper we went to the stockade where they
were to sleep, to hold a service. Such singing I never
heard. Then "Mother Wheaton" preached, prayed and
sang. If ever God answered prayer He surely did for those
poor women and in place of that stockade there is now a
new prison house with things reasonably comfortable.</p>

<p>We went to other farms, stockades and prisons. I do
thank God for the privilege of going into these places where
"Mother Wheaton" was the first white woman to visit or
to pray and sing. Regardless of danger in approaching
these out-of-the-way places, her love for God and for those
who were despised and downtrodden, carried her through
untold hardships. We were at times in danger of bloodhounds,
alligators and venomous reptiles.</p>

<p>I am sure that through her intercession with governors
and wardens and superintendents "Mother Wheaton's" work
has proved a blessing to thousands of prisoners. I have seen
the results of her work in many of the states. Her preaching
and singing have been used of God, but above all I knew
that the hours of prevailing prayer have been a still greater
power for good. In answer to prayer God has opened doors
and done many wonderful things whereof we are glad.</p>

<p>Again we went to the South to visit prisons and stockades
where we had been in former years. Great changes
had been made. There was much improvement in their
condition. I hope the time may soon come when only the
law of love and kindness shall prevail.</p>

<p>We held street meetings in many places. One night after
holding one of these open-air services we boarded a train.
A man and wife came on the train. She told us that her
husband had attended the street meeting and was under
such conviction for sin that he could not rest. There on
the train, while we knelt in the aisle of the car, he was converted
to God and went on his way rejoicing, while we went
to visit a penitentiary where hundreds of men and women
needed the same work of grace wrought in their hearts.</p>

<p>Often we saw answers to prayer in the healing of prisoners
who were sick. God's Word is true. He says He is
no respecter of persons, and He is able to do more than we
can ask or think. May God bless every soul for whom we
have prayed.</p>

<p>Sister Wheaton and myself have spent many long hours
at a time together pleading for the men and women behind
the bars. It means much to be divinely called to this
work.</p>

<p>Oh! how many with broken hearts lie in the lonely cells
every night! May God help everyone who reads these
pages to remember that there is one MOTHER of all the
prisoners who weeps and prays in sympathy with them.
I wish every mother and wife, or sister, who has a precious
one "in the shadow of the walls," would pray for "Mother
Wheaton," that she may be helped of God in preaching the
Word, and that God's blessing may rest upon her for her
kind loving words and the hand-clasp that reaches so many
hearts. Pray that health and strength may be given her as
she comes in and goes out among these erring ones.</p>

<p>I know she has been through deep waters and great sorrows.
Her life has been one of self-sacrifice in behalf of
the unfortunate. May God bless and help her and give
her the crown of righteousness that is laid up for the
faithful.</p>

<p>One night after worship at the home of the warden with
whom we were stopping, Sister Wheaton was singing a
hymn, when suddenly the warden asked, "Sister Wheaton,
will you come over into the prison-yard and finish that
hymn?" She replied she would gladly do so if he thought
it would do good. So we hastened to the prison-yard, some
little distance away, and quietly entered the enclosure, and
she began singing. Her clear, strong voice awakened the
sleeping prisoners. The incident was so unusual that some
of them (as we were told afterward), negroes especially,
awaking suddenly, thought that the Judgment Day had
come, and tumbling out of bed, fell upon their knees and
began praying for God to have mercy upon them and save
their souls; so God evidently used the song to bring conviction
to hearts. After the singing we returned as quietly
as we had come, trusting the results with God.</p>

<h3>Work in Fort Madison, Iowa, and Santa Fe, New
Mexico</h3>


<p>Soon after starting out in my work, when changing cars
in an Iowa town I saw a crowd of people who were curiously
gazing upon three young men who were handcuffed,
and bound together being taken to the state's prison
at Fort Madison. I went up to them, shook hands,
and said, "I am sorry for you. Don't be discouraged.
Cheer up. Give God your hearts. Obey the rules.
Do the best you can and God will do the rest." They
seemed cheered and relieved seeing I neither feared nor
shunned them. I inquired their names and told them I
would try to see them in prison, but did not know how soon.</p>

<p>A few weeks later I went to Fort Madison and obtained
permission of the Chaplain, W. C. Gunn, to hold a meeting
the following Sunday. This was my first effort to hold divine
service in a prison. Then I inquired for the three
young men I had seen when on their way there, but could
find no record of them. I assured the Chaplain they were
there and observing the prisoners closely I saw one of them
at work. As our eyes met, I saw a look of distress on his
face. He recognized me and was afraid I would tell who
he was. He had given a ficticious name&mdash;as had also the
others.</p>

<p>But before Sunday came I began to think: "What if I
should make a mistake and could think of nothing to say
when I come before all those hundreds of prisoners?" And
then there were the officers in their suits of blue with brass
buttons! It all seemed too much for me, and, like Jonah,
I took ship and ran away.</p>

<p>That night I started by steamer for Mobile, Alabama&mdash;but
God knew I did not mean to disobey and He let me
work among the stockades in the south until I got boldness
to enter other prisons. After a year or more I returned
to Fort Madison and was granted the privilege offered me
before and from that time to this I have always been made
welcome there and have had many blessed seasons within
these walls. There is no place where I have been more
kindly received by both officers and prisoners than at Fort
Madison. Chaplain Gunn and wife were always true and
loyal friends. 'Tis now several years since he crossed over
to the better shore. I shall ever remember with deep gratitude
the kindness of himself and family. Chaplain Jessup
and wife, and Warden Jones and wife, as well as other
officials, have been especially kind and courteous. To the
prisoners at Fort Madison, also, I must give the credit of
contributing freely from their small savings to my necessities.
While I would gladly mention all who have especially
befriended me I feel that this tribute is due to the officers
and men of Fort Madison. That it is deserved may be
easily seen by the following communications and selections
from letters which I find among my papers:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Warden's Office, Iowa Penitentiary,<br />
Fort Madison, Iowa, August 3, 1889.
</p>

<p>The bearer, Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton, a devoted Christian woman,
has for years been visiting the prisons and jails of this country
seeking to do good to their inmates. I think she should be kindly
received and encouraged by prison authorities. I do not think any
one has ever spoken to the convicts in this prison with better effect
and I am sure that no one who has ever addressed them will be longer
or more kindly remembered by them than Mrs. Wheaton. I heartily
commend her and her good work to those engaged in prison management
and to good people everywhere as most deserving of their aid
and encouragement. It affords me all the more pleasure to give
Mrs. Wheaton this testimonial because it was unsolicited and because
of the unobtrusive way in which she goes about doing good.</p>

<p>My Dear Mother: I will first ask your pardon for not answering
your letter sooner. But I am always so busy the last days of the

<blockquote><p>My acquaintance with Mrs. Wheaton began four years ago, at
the first Sunday service I held as chaplain of this prison. Standing
by my office window before the men had come into the chapel,
I saw a motherly-appearing lady enter the prison, escorted by
the assistant deputy. A few moments later we met on the chapel
platform, and I was introduced to "Mother Wheaton," the woman
who for many years had, in prisons and jails, all over the country,
sought to quicken in the prisoners' bosom a new life, and lead
to the Savior those who all their lives have been rejecting Him.
It was my first service with the men, as I have said, and I felt
constrained to preach as I had come prepared to do, although on
subsequent visits I have gladly granted all the time to Mother
Wheaton. After I had preached, Mrs. Wheaton talked, and sang,
and prayed, and many of the men were visibly affected, some to
tears, by her earnest pleading. Later she went to my office and
met a boy who was soon going out, and prayed and talked with
him in a manner that must have made him determine to strive for
a better manhood. Our prison has received several visits from
Mother Wheaton since then, and always, I believe, with lasting
good to the men, over many of whom she has exerted an influence
for good. Earnest, apt and ready in speech, always seeming to
live close to God, and to hold instant communion with Him, and
consecrated soul and body, time and means, to her work&mdash;these
perhaps account for her useful service. That she has a ready
sense of humor, too, is perhaps one reason the "boys" listen to
her so well. I recall one incident. She had come down from
Burlington, where she was obliged to secure a pass on the railroad.
The proper officer not being at hand, she went from one to
another, until at last one was found with authority to issue a pass,
but who did not know her or her mission. "On what ground
do you want a pass?" said the railroad man. "I am working for
God, and He owns the railroads," was the unexpected reply.
"But, madam, where are you going?" gasped the official. Quick
as a flash came the answer, "To heaven!" But by this time the
railroad man had recovered from his surprise, and seemed equal
to the emergency, and proved himself to be a gentleman as well,
for he said quietly: "If that is your destination, madam, I am
unable to accommodate you, for I regret to say the place is not on
our line; but if you want a pass to any place on our road you can
have it." In relating the incident in the prison chapel Mother
Wheaton added that she secured her pass to Fort Madison, and
that when she reached here she thought she was next to heaven,
for here she had first attempted her work for souls, in State's
Prisons, and here she believed many precious trophies for the
Master had been given her.</p>

<p>I noticed on her last visit that while she seemed in usual health,
her hair was whiter, betokening the gathering years. I could
wish that now she who for so many years has not known the
blessing of home, might find a place in which to spend in rest and
communion with God, and helpful but gentle ministrations, the
balance of her life, until He whom she has followed in her efforts
to do good, may say: "Come up higher, thou blessed of my
Father. Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these my brethren
ye did it unto me."</p>

<h4>WORK IN SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO.</h4>

<p>Several interesting experiences have occurred in connection
with my visits to the prison at Santa Fe, New Mexico.
At one time I found there a good old Christian man, "a
trusty," who had charge of the Superintendent's horses,
driving the family to town, etc., and had much liberty given
him. One day he sat in front of me, driving to town, and
I said to him, "I am going to pray to God to remove the
'stripes' from you." He said, "Pray for my release&mdash;I
know God hears prayer." I did so, as did also my good
co-workers, returned missionaries home from Africa
on a visit. In three or four days the warden gave him
citizens' clothes; and soon after the governor gave him his
pardon.</p>

<p>We were led to pray for a pardon for brother T. of the
same prison, and in three months he was a free man. At
the time I had a sister with me from Japan. On my return
from the Pacific coast we again held services in the prison
at Santa Fe, and during the meeting I said, "What do you
want me to sing, boys?" One said, "Sing, 'Some Mother's
Boy.'" I did so, and in the morning, before I left the
prison, the officer said to me, "Here is two dollars a man
sent in from the prison for you." Upon inquiring the
name of the prisoner I found it was J. L. As they told
me he was a good man, a Christian, and a good prisoner,
I took his case also to the Lord in prayer. Within three
weeks he was given a pardon by the governor. The three
men mentioned were all Christians.</p>

<p>In none of these cases did I go to the governor, but just
left all in God's hands, and prayed if God was pleased to
set these men free, that He would impress the governor to
give them their release. These cases occurred at different
times. I am sure that the hope of pardon has in many cases
saved the lives of prisoners, and also saved them from insanity.</p>

<p>I give below a letter received from Brother T., also
quote from a sketch of his life, as published by McAuley
Water Street Mission, N. Y., and sent me by himself; also
letters from the Secretary of the Christian Endeavor Society
of the Santa Fe Prison, and very kind letters from Governor
Thornton, Superintendent H. O. Bursom, and Brother
S. H. Hadley, of Water Street Mission.</p>

<p>Dear Mother Wheaton:
</p>

<p>I suppose you will be surprised to hear from me. The last time
I saw you was in the Santa Fe Territorial Prison. You had a
meeting in the cell house. I was the trusty who went with you
to the depot. If you remember, you prayed for the removal of
the number from the back of No. 917 and that he would be freed;
you also told me you would pray that I would get out of prison.
Your prayers have been answered. I was pardoned last Christmas,
and am here working among the criminal classes as a missionary.
You remember of my having been converted before your visit to
the prison. It is a great blessing to me to spend the balance of
my life thus, who had been sent to prison for forty years, under
conviction and sentence for a crime of which I was perfectly
innocent, although I was a great sinner in other respects.</p>

<h4>SENTENCED TO FORTY YEARS IN PRISON.</h4>

<blockquote><p>On the night of July 6, 18&mdash;&mdash;, I was playing the banjo in a notorious
gambling house in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It had been
my business for years and I liked the surroundings; they suited me
exactly; in fact, I have traveled from my home in the East, from
city to city, through all the slumdum of the western cities playing
my banjo; I thoroughly enjoyed it and the company which it
brought me. * * * I was arrested on suspicion and locked in
jail. I had no money, no friends and no character, and I began
to realize for the first time what my life was bringing me. I
was finally brought to trial and convicted on circumstantial evidence,
and sentenced to forty years in prison for a crime that I
knew nothing more about than the judge who sat upon the bench.</p>

<p>Dear reader, can you enter into this story with me; can you
form an idea of my despair as I received practically a life sentence
for something which I did not do? My heart was hard and
bitter against myself and everybody else as I was taken to the
Territorial penitentiary at Santa Fe, New Mexico. I was in the
prime of life, only 28 years old, but, oh, what steps I had already
taken in the downward path that leadeth unto death. Every evil
habit had fastened itself upon me, and after I had taken my place
in the prison I almost went wild with terror and despair when I
realized what was before me. I was soon set to work with pick
and shovel digging out trenches on the grounds, and I tried to do
the work the best I could and be a good prisoner. I presume I
was, for a little time afterward I was placed in the library, and
had charge of the greenhouse as well.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon in the chapel the speaker took for his
text, St. John, 3, 14th and 15th verses: "As Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted
up;"</p>

<p>"That whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
everlasting life."</p>

<p>The speaker dwelt at length on this actual occurrence and also
how God commanded Moses to erect a pole with the brass serpent,
and although there were there people dying by the thousands, those
that looked on that brazen serpent were healed. He brought the application
home to us prisoners&mdash;how the serpent of sin had stung us
so deeply and our only remedy was to look to Jesus Christ, who
was lifted up on the cross, and my hard heart began to melt and a
desire came to me to be healed of this terrible serpent's bite.
The speaker instructed us when we got back to our cells to read
this whole chapter, and when I got back to my cell I took up the
book and read, and I prayed to God to open my heart so that I
could understand what He wanted of me, and as I read the blessed
Holy Spirit came to my poor soul and showed me what a sinful
man I was, and I then and there became a child of God. Great
peace came to my soul, which at first I could scarcely understand,
but although still a prisoner and wearing the stripes, I was a
free man in Christ Jesus, and I rejoiced in my new found life.
After this, prison life was not so dreary as it was before.</p>

<p>Among the many different workers who came to the prison was
Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Wood, of Santa Fe; he is Mail Agent on the
road. He is a blessed man, and one who loves the prisoners. Another
person I would like to mention is the person known as
"Mother Wheaton." I think I should speak of a little circumstance
that happened to one prisoner who went by the number
917, and who wore this number in great big cloth figures on his
back; he drove "Mother Wheaton" to town, as he was a
"trusty," and she said that she was going to pray that the Lord
would take that number off his back, and in a few days after that
the Warden came in with a new suit of clothes for him without
the stripes or number&mdash;citizen's clothes. She once said to me:
"I am going to pray to the Lord to get you out of here," reminding
me of the prayer she made for No. 917. "Mother Wheaton"
prayed for my release. On Christmas day, 1902, three months
after the above conversation took place, I was in the chapel of the
prison in the entertainment that was going on. Governor Otero
sat in the balcony.</p>

<p>The custom is that someone shall receive a pardon on Christmas
day, and no one has any intimation who it is excepting the
Governor. I had not the slightest idea that I would be the lucky
man, and after the Assistant Superintendent asked that I play a
certain composition of my own, he requested me to step out and he
read the pardon; to my surprise my name was in the pardon, and,
oh, the joy that came to me when I began to realize that I was a
free man, but, dear reader, this pardon, great as it was, did not
compare with the joy that came in my soul as I realized that I
had received the pardon from my Redeemer, and that all my sins
were forgiven and all my past crimes blotted out.</p>

<p>While in the prison I read an account in a paper of the experience
of S. H. Hadley, who was then in New York connected with
the Jerry McAuley Mission, and I was desirous of going to New
York to meet this man. I did so, and before I had been ten
minutes in his office he told me what already was filling my soul,
that I should be a worker for Christ and try to save those who
had fallen, and the down-trodden. I stepped out on the Lord's
promises with but very little knowledge, except the knowledge of
sins forgiven, and a big hope in my soul of eternal life, and a love
that I cannot express, without one dollar in my pocket, but with
the simple faith in Jesus. I am working every night and day at
every door that is open, and every one that I can open, where I
can tell the wonderful story of Jesus' love to sinners. Dear
reader, pray for me that God may wonderfully use me.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. R. Wheaton has been paying our institution visits on various
occasions for some years past, and during these visits has done
very much valuable work towards furthering the discipline of the
institution. Her words of comfort and wholesome advice together
with her teachings of Christianity has cheered many a poor, unfortunate
soul up to believing and hoping for a better future; to realize
that justice demands that some punishment be meted out to wrong
doers and violators of the laws of the land; that such punishment
is not eternal; that they can receive consolation and comfort their
conscience even inside of the prison walls by resolving to be better
men, by a closer observance of the moral laws as dictated by their
conscience, a faithful compliance of their duties as men or women,
and a strict obedience to their overseers acting under the law and,
above all, an abiding faith in the Almighty God.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton has taught them to understand that they must not
only resolve but must demonstrate by their actions in every day
life a sincerity of purpose.</p>

<p>The management feels very grateful indeed for the splendid work
so generously devoted in the interest of humanity, which I consider
also a most valuable assistance to the prison management in maintaining
discipline and turning out discharged prisoners as better men

earn and care for those who may be dependent upon them.</p>

<p>"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer."</p></blockquote>


<p>One of the most touching things, and to me the most important
of all this God-appointed work, has been my special
mission to those who are doomed to execution.</p>

<p>If there ever is a time in our lives when we need a
friend, it is when we are sick, in trouble, or about to die.
The last words of our loved ones are very dear to us all.
Nearly every home has at some time had a call from the
death angel. And looking through the bureau drawer, you
might see the little garments, shoes and playthings that
used to be our darlings' before they went away. Turn the
leaves of the old Family Bible and you will see hidden between
its pages a lock of hair, perhaps father's or mother's.
We look up to Heaven through our blinding tears,
and cry out between our sobs: "Oh, God, help me to say
'Thy will be done.'"</p>

<p>In looking over my packages of old letters from the departed
ones who have paid the penalty of a violated law,
dying either in the electric chair or on the scaffold, I find
them coming to pieces, some so badly worn I can scarcely
read them. And I know the hands that penned them are
now returning back to dust.</p>

<p>In order to show how God saves when they are truly
penitent, even men of this class, who are counted the worst
of criminals, I will give an account of a few instances
which have come under my own observation, and extracts
from some of the letters I have received&mdash;written before
execution. And let us remember that our Savior declared
that every sin shall be forgiven to men, except the sin
against the Holy Ghost.</p>


<h4>INDIFFERENT BUT FINALLY CONVERTED.</h4>

<p>The first one who was converted under my ministry, before
going to the scaffold, was executed in August, 1885,
in the state of Kentucky. On going to jail I found this
young man there with the sentence of death upon him. The
burden of his lost condition came upon my soul in great
power. I felt I should die unless he was saved, and cried
mightily to God for his conviction and conversion. I held
several meetings there and was entertained a part of the
time by the sheriff's wife, who was a Christian lady. She,
too, was very anxious for this young man's salvation. As
I took the train to leave the place, his mother accompanied
me to the depot&mdash;crying and pleading, "Oh, pray for my
poor boy. It will surely kill me." The bitter wail of that
mother's heart seems to still ring in my ears. Letters from
the sheriff's wife came often, telling me of the boy's still
seeming indifferent. But she said that he often inquired
about me and wanted to see me.</p>

<p>I prayed for this soul almost incessantly for forty-five
days, being scarcely able to sleep at night; and he was
finally converted. After his conversion I received from
him the following letters:</p>

<blockquote><p class="signature">
&mdash;&mdash;, KY., August 5, 1885.</p>

<p>My Dear Friend:
</p>

<p>I received your card this morning and was very glad to hear from
you indeed. Mrs. Wheaton, I feel my Savior in my heart. I know
that He will save my soul. I am praying to my God every hour in
the day. I am praying for God to place something in my heart to
tell the people when I go to the scaffold. I want to tell them what
my Savior has placed in my heart&mdash;the man that suffered and died
that I should have everlasting life. I wish you could be with me
once more on earth to sing and pray with me, but if not, I will meet
you on that other shore. My friend Charley is praying and singing
with me every day and night and says he will meet us in the kingdom.
They are all well here but Mrs. N. (the sheriff's wife). She
has been sick, but is better now. I would like to be with you once
more before I die, and if not, look out for me when you reach that
happy land. Good-by, good-by. Remember me in your prayers. I
have yet nine days to live.</p>

two days more I will be at rest. I have been praying to my Father
to teach me something to tell the world at my last hour. I would
like to tell everybody what my dear Savior has done for me. He has
given me what I asked Him for and He will go with me to the scaffold.
I will see you again, "In the fair and happy land, just across
on the evergreen shore." I am ready to go home to rest. I have

am in my cell and it is very dark for me to write, but I do my best.
I fast and pray most all the time. Good-by once more for a while.</p>

<p>Below is an extract from a letter written by the sheriff's
wife to me shortly after the execution took place:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dear Sister:
</p>

<p>I fulfill the promise I made to poor Henry the day he was executed,
to write you a letter and tell you all about him after he was
gone to that bright glory land. It would have done you good to
have seen him the last three days he lived. He was as happy as he
could be. He had a smile on his countenance all the time and never
broke down, no difference who of his friends came to see him. He
talked to his mother and brothers so nice and gave them such good
advice. He told his mother to not grieve after him, but to rejoice,
for he would be so much better off after he was gone, for he knew
that he would be at rest. And if they would live and do right they
could come to him. The people that were here that day (and there
were between four and five thousand) were surprised to see the
beautiful countenance he left the prison with. He helped to sing that
beautiful hymn,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"And must I be to judgment brought,</span>
<span class="i1">And answer in that day</span>
<span class="i0">For every vain and idle thought</span>
<span class="i1">And every word I say?"</span>
</div>

<p>with the chorus,</p>

<p class="left10">
"We are passing away,"
</p>

<p>and he was heard distinctly by all. He clapped his hands while he was
singing; then he stepped on to the trap and was soon gone. He had
a prayer on his lips when the black cap was drawn over his face,
and said, "Good-by" to all his friends, and repeated, "Good-by."
He told me to tell you he expected to meet you in heaven. His
mother and brothers send their kindest regards to you. May God
bless you.</p>

<h4>MOTHER'S PRAYERS.</h4>

<p>The case of C&mdash;&mdash; was one of most intense interest to the
public as well as his immediate friends. For long months
I wept and prayed for this young man. He was hoping for
a new trial. He was always glad to see me and to have me
sing for him. He was refined, educated, a member of "one
of the F. F. V.'s," as they say, yet doomed to die on the
scaffold. How my heart longed to see him saved&mdash;for Jesus,
too, was longing for his salvation.</p>

<p>I was called to other fields of labor before the fatal day
and was not sure of his acceptance with God, but can but
hope that his poor mother's prayers and mine were heard
in heaven and that that poor, misguided youth whose every
wish had before been gratified was forgiven. We can but
cast the mantle of charity over the case and leave it with
Him who wills not that any should perish but that all should
turn to Him and live. He wrote me the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Mrs. E. R. Wheaton, Prison Missionary:
</p>

<p>I appreciate very highly your kindness and sympathy and more
so your prayers. I trust we may all meet in a better land. Return
my thanks to Mrs. Gen T&mdash;&mdash;. Respectfully,</p>
<p class="signature">T. J. C.</p>
<p>Aug. 24, 1885.
</p></blockquote>


<h4>CLAIMED TO BE INNOCENT.</h4>

<p>The following letter is from one who was executed in
1887. He declared to the very last that he was innocent of
the crime for which he was convicted. He always maintained
to me that the person he was supposed to have murdered
committed suicide under circumstances which threw
suspicion upon him. For myself, I do not believe in capital
punishment and certainly if it is ever justifiable it is not
in any case that leaves a possibility of doubt regarding the
guilt of the accused.</p>

<p>In spite of great hindrances, being in the place, I was
led to visit the jail. After having sung for some of the
other prisoners an officer came to me asking if I would go
down below to visit a condemned man who had heard me
sing and requested that I would come to him. Of course I
went&mdash;though the opening to his cell was so small that I
had to stoop very low to get in. If I remember rightly he
claimed to be converted that day. I was obliged to leave
the city soon after, but heard from him several times before
his execution.</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Petersburg, Va., April, 1887.
</p>

<p>My Dear Friend: I received your postal and will answer it at
once. I was very glad to hear from you, especially as you remind
me so much of my dear old mother&mdash;not exactly now, but as she
was about fifteen years ago. * * *</p>

<p>Mrs. R. sang the same hymn for me that I heard you sing to
those in the room above me. She said she would, if she had the
chance before she left the city, write it for me and bring it to me,
but as she has not been here yet I fear she has left, so I will be very
glad if you will be so kind as to write it for me. It is beautiful.</p>

<p>I was very sorry you left so soon. I would have been so glad for
you to have been in town longer so you could have called at least
once more! But if I never see you on this earth it is comforting
to know we may meet in heaven. But, O God! had I received justice,
today I would be as free as the birds of the field. There is a
blessed hope in knowing while we are persecuted by men, it is only
the body they can persecute on this earth, the soul is out of their
reach. And before the flesh is cold in death my soul will be soaring
above in the realms of bliss to be forever blessed! O forever! Forevermore!
It is one of the most consoling of all consolations for
me to know that it is only the condemnation of man and the so-called
law of the land by which I was convicted&mdash;not by&mdash;no, not
by&mdash;the great Judge of all hearts and not by justice at all. Only
condemned by man&mdash;not by my God and justice. But it is all in
God's hands and He will repay, for "Vengeance is mine," saith the
Lord. Vengeance is not mine nor do I wish to revenge any one.
* * * "Revenge is sweet," is an old adage, but not to me to get
revenge and by so doing lose my own soul, for what is the whole
world to gain and lose your own soul? I am charged with that
of which I am not guilty, but my protestation is in no way believed.
Neither was the only pure one who ever trod the soil of this earth.
He was caught and charged, accused, condemned&mdash;yes, more than
that, was crucified. Was he guilty? No&mdash;emphatically no. But his
innocence could not save him. Nor did mine do me any good in
my trial at all. But, thank God, it will do me good in the world
to come, where I will receive justice and I will not be in danger of
prejudice as lies and prejudice are the cause of my being in this
lonely cell today. * * *</p>

<p>All the boys in the room over me request me to be remembered
in my letter to you kindly. Many thanks to you for those tracts you
sent me. I hope to be remembered in your daily appeals to our
Maker, in whose care I prayerfully submit myself and you to his
keeping in the future. God grant it and may we meet in heaven.
Hoping this will in no way offend you and that it may be answered
soon to one in solitude&mdash;yet not alone; condemned&mdash;yet not
guilty. Your brother in Christ,</p>

<h4>HARDENED IN CRIME.</h4>

<p>The case of the writer of the following communications
(which were written on postal cards) was one of note. He
was supposed to be so hardened in crime and so void of
feeling that there was no hope for him&mdash;that nothing could
reach or save him. But I believed that God loved him just
as the Word teaches us, and I laid hold on the promises
of the Bible for his soul's salvation. I am sure that God
never turns a penitent soul away empty who comes to Him
in faith, feeling that He is a rewarder of those who diligently
seek Him. "O ye of little faith, wherefore didst
thou doubt?"</p>

<p>After the light of God broke in upon this poor man's
soul he saw that he was a wretched sinner, but that there
was pardon and peace for all who truly repent of their sins
and who confess and forsake them. To such God has
given the promise of eternal life and that the blood of
Jesus Christ his Son shall cleanse their hearts from all
sin. This man was convinced of his need of a Savior and
deeply convicted of sin and we believe was made ready to
meet God. He seemed very deeply thankful to me for my
untiring efforts in his behalf and surprised at my faith and
confidence in God for him, and through these He was
brought by the power of the Spirit unto repentance toward
God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">

<p>My Dear, Kind Friend:
</p>

<p>I received your welcome postal and it makes me happy to read
it. I am now ready to go to my fate. I pray every night and
day for God to forgive me. I put my whole trust in Him. Pray
for me that God will wash my sins away and receive me in heaven.
As I expect God to forgive me I forgive and love everybody.

I go on my long journey, for I love to hear you pray. Good-bye.

in his heavenly home, where there is no sin or sorrow, but where
all is love and peace. I have now but five short days until all
that is of the world will be consigned to the tomb and I do so
pray night and day that Jesus will cleanse me of my sins. I
think this will be the last time you will hear from me on this
earth and when I go to eternity I do so praising God, forgiving my
enemies, firm in faith and the belief that my sins are washed
away in the blood of Jesus. Good-bye. May we meet in heaven.</p>

<p>In 1888 I visited a county jail so crowded with prisoners
that I wondered how they could live in that poorly ventilated,
filthy prison. They had little to eat and evidently no
one to care for them. There were Indians, Mexicans,
white and colored all together. There I found <small>TEN MEN
UNDER DEATH SENTENCE</small>; and I was convinced that several
were innocent of the charges laid against them&mdash;being condemned
by circumstantial evidence. Those ten condemned
men were made the subject of constant, earnest prayer.
O, if judges and jurymen could only know what eternal
destinies hang upon their decisions, surely they would be
less ready to condemn on less than positive evidence. Several
of the ten were executed&mdash;among them the writer of
the following letter:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">

<p>My Dear Sister:

<p>We received your postal. I was so glad to receive it from those

me. Jesus Christ is the subject of my day talk and night dreams.
I remember you when I get down on my knees to pray. I pray
for the Lord's will to be done with me as it is done in heaven.
I have forsaken the world for Jesus' sake. His love is shed abroad
in my heart. Myself and Brothers W. and A. (whose sentences
have been changed) are still serving God&mdash;also Brother S. I could
not tell you how it is with the other boys, but I talk to them

<h4>CONVERSION OF A JEWISH BOY.</h4>

<p>In the same year, I found in one of the prisons of California,
a young Jew under sentence of death. While under
the influence of drink, he shot the girl he truly loved. He
never realized it till he became sober and found himself in
prison. Naturally he was surprised and greatly shocked.
Wondering why he was there, and being told of his crime,
he was overwhelmed with grief, and remorse of conscience.
Poor boy! His was a sad ending. He was so grief-stricken!
And yet the courts were against him, and the world
at large, for the sin was pronounced murder in the first
degree and he must die&mdash;<em>a boy in his teens</em>.</p>

<p>As I looked through the grating at the poor doomed boy,
an old gentleman spoke to me and said something very
unkind about him. The boy said, "That man is a <em>hypocrite</em>.
But I like those hymns you sang. <em>Won't you sing for me?</em>"
So I sang for him, and he requested me not to talk to him
then. So I said, "Can I come and see you again?" "<em>Oh,
yes, come again, do."</em> This poor boy was one of the lost
ones, and Jesus touched his heart while I sang, "Meet me
there." This was from that time on his favorite hymn,
and I sang it for him just before he went to the scaffold.</p>

<p>I went back and forth from San Francisco to other
places for six weeks, but his case lay very heavy upon my
heart. I knew that on the 14th of September he was to go,
and that worse still, he was in danger of eternal death. I
pleaded and wept for him day and night, that he might be
brought to see his lost condition and his need of Christ
and yield to God. How I bless God that He hears and
answers prayer! "If any man see his brother sin a sin
which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him
life for them that sin not unto death."&mdash;1 John 5:16.</p>

<p>Before his conversion I received from him the following
letters, beautifully and correctly written:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
San Francisco, Aug. 9, 1888.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Wheaton:
</p>

<p>As to religion I do not profess any creed. I do not mean by
the above that I hate them&mdash;on the contrary, I love religion and
hate hypocrisy. I am not an atheist and must admit that I believe
in a true, just and most merciful God. I appreciate your
visits very much and hope you will call to see me as often as
opportunity and convenience will allow, so I now close this brief
epistle by sending kindest regards and best wishes. I am</p>

<p class="signature2">
Respectfully,</p>
<p class="signature">&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Condemned Cell."<br />
<br />
P. S.&mdash;Kind thanks for singing.
</p></blockquote>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<blockquote><p class="head">
San Francisco, Sept. 7, 1888.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton:
</p>

<p>I am pleased that you called to see me and hope you will
repeat your visits. It grieves me to see you shed tears, and although
I say nothing, remember that "still water runs deep." I
have faith and believe in prayer, so I believe that the cause of a
condemned boy will be heard in heaven and will come to pass. I
am not allowed to shake hands, much less give my mother a comforting
kiss. I now end by thanking you very kindly for your
kindness and consideration to me.</p>

<p class="center">
I am, respectfully,</p>
<p class="signature">&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I went, the day before the execution, to see him. No
one was allowed to go inside the doomed boy's cell, so I
was compelled to submit to the law. The sheriff said positively,
"No, you cannot go inside." But the chief jailer
said, "I promised that this lady should go inside the boy's
cell before the execution, and I must keep my word. I
will go in with her." He opened the door and we went in.
He was a grand man. Myself and the sister who was with
me prayed for the prisoner's salvation. We sang and read
and prayed, and at last the presence of the Holy Spirit
seemed to fill the gloomy little cell, and to touch the poor
boy kneeling there with the shackles on his limbs. (They
frequently put shackles on some days before the execution,
and place them in the "doomed cell.") We kept on praying
and singing and at last the light came into his heart,
and God owned him as His child.</p>

<p>On the morning of the execution, I went early to the
prison; and as I hurried along there met me a young Catholic
priest, who was our mutual friend, and very kind. He
said, "<em>Come quickly, the boy wants you.</em> He has called for
you all night, and they could not find you, so they came for
me. I have been waiting for you." This priest had labored
with me to convince the poor boy that Jesus was the Christ
and that He alone could save him. I hurried on into the
prison for my last greeting on earth with the poor condemned
boy. There was no loud demonstration&mdash;he was
going to die, and knew it; but he felt that he was ready.
He said to me: "I can hardly wait the hour to go home.
I am willing and ready to die. O sing for me my favorite
songs. I wish you could go with me to the scaffold, but
that is against the law for women to go to the execution
in this state." Mothers could not endure such things, but
I feel, when permitted, as if I must stay till all is over.</p>

<p>I took a white silk handkerchief and gently folded it
around the boy's neck, and said, "I think the rope won't
hurt so bad, and the pain won't be so severe with this
around your neck." I shall never forget the grateful look
on his face, as he smilingly thanked me. He was a very
refined young man, and only for whiskey he might be living
yet. As I bade him good-bye he said, "Please sing for
me <em>once more</em> before I go." I sang and passed out among
the crowds of people. I seemed to be lifted above the
things of earth&mdash;I was so thankful for his salvation. Reader,
do you know what it is to travail for a soul and then
count the hours and moments till you see them go over the
river of death, and by-and-by with the eye of faith see
them enter the pearly gates into the presence of Him who
was crucified for them?</p>

<p>After the execution I received the following kind letter
from the young priest to whom I have referred:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
San Francisco, Oct. 13, 1888.</p>

<p>Dear Madam:
</p>

<p>It was with great pleasure I read your kind and welcome note.
I thank you very much for your pleasant remembrance and hope
that God will bless your efforts and sacrifices on behalf of the
poor prisoners.</p>

<p>In regard to A., I can say that he was resigned to the last and
died well prepared, in my opinion. I was with him almost constantly
during the last twelve hours. I think his family placed
the silk handkerchief in the coffin with him.</p>

<p>Please give my regards to your kind companion and say sometimes
a little prayer for me. I hope to see you soon in San Francisco
and have the pleasure of renewing my acquaintance. I
have the honor of remaining,</p>

<p class="signature2">
Yours truly in Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="signature">Rev. N&mdash;&mdash; F&mdash;&mdash;.

<h4>MYSTERIOUSLY GUIDED.</h4>

<p>In April, 1891, I was in Kansas City, Mo. After waiting
upon the Lord for some days asking Him where He would
have me go next I was impressed to go to the depot and
that there it would be shown me what I must do. I did so,
but even then was left for several hours in uncertainty as
to what train to take, as I had passes on four different
lines. I spent the time in earnest prayer. At last, toward
evening, I was led to take the Rock Island train for Chicago
and impressed that the Lord would show me when
and where to stop. I had two sisters and a little boy with
me and they could not understand my indecision.</p>

<p>As our train hurried on during the night, I kept asking
the Lord where I should stop, and He made it very plain
to me that I was to stop at Ottawa, Ill. I knew no one
there, and there was no state-prison there, but the Lord
showed me to go to the county jail and when I did so
found there were several men there soon to be executed.
I was told that no one was permitted to see them; but we
went praying and the Lord touched the hearts of the officers
and we were permitted to hold a service. We were
much helped of the Holy Spirit and I believe some of these
condemned men were saved&mdash;at least they seemed to give
evidence of it. One of them afterwards wrote me two letters.
These I give to my readers. It is well to remember,
however, that not many such prisoners are accustomed to
expressing their thoughts in writing and hence their letters
fail to express the depth of feeling clearly shown in their
words and manner when I am with them. Again all their
letters are to be read before they leave the prison, so they
do not open their hearts as freely when writing as when
speaking with me alone.</p>

<p>Dear Sister: We are doing very well. As for Mr. C. and myself,
we will do the best we can to reach that Beautiful home in the
New Jerusalem, for the Lord saith: "He that believeth and abideth
in Me shall have everlasting life." As you must have seen, our belief
is a little different from yours in some respects, but, nevertheless,
we are all working for that one place and that is heaven. He
that leaveth his sins behind him shall be saved. The example of
those who died for Christ, for the faith and for virtue's sake are
also continually placed before us that we may learn to endure sufferings
and even death rather than be unfaithful to God and stain
our conscience with sin. The Christian's motto is, "Death before
dishonor." Hoping that you will continue to pray for us that we
may be cleansed from sin and be saved, we send you our sincere
and hearty wishes for your welfare. God bless you and keep you

<h4>IN LONG EXPECTATION.</h4>

<p>I first saw E. B&mdash;&mdash; in the jail in Wichita, Kansas. There
were many prisoners there at that time and especially in
the Oklahoma ward. It was soon after the opening up of
Oklahoma territory and the rush for claims. There was
great excitement and many lost their lives. Some were
thrown from their horses and killed. Others died from
exhaustion, running as for life to get the property they so
much coveted. There were many things done that were
wrong. Some are still lingering inside prison walls for
"defending their rights" as they thought. I do not remember
just what E.'s trouble was, but he was sentenced to
death and the day and the hour were set. I went often to
the prison and sang and prayed for the prisoners. They
were my friends. I knew and loved them as a mother
would, and especially this young boy&mdash;the youngest of
them all.</p>

<p>I went away to Europe and on my return I again visited
the jail in Wichita to hold a service. While singing the
first hymn the jailer came into the apartment where I was
and said, "The Oklahoma boys have heard you singing and
want you to come at once to their ward. They did not
know you had returned from Scotland and are so anxious
to see you." And such a welcome as those dear boys and
men gave me I had received no where else since my return.
Some were under death sentences. O how my heart aches
even now as I think of the tears they shed and of their
warm handclasp. Then I could only fall on my knees and
sob out my sorrow for them and my heartfelt thanks to
God for the warm welcome and as I wept and prayed I
believe good was accomplished and souls saved. Some are
dead and gone. Others are in the asylum for the criminal
insane. A few were pardoned out. Eddie's case lingered.
While hoping for a commutation of sentence he wrote the
following letter:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Wichita, May 3, 1891.</p>

<p>Dear Friend:
</p>

<p>I received your kind letter. Was glad to hear you were well and
still at your post, working for others. I am still in my little cell
awaiting what comes and have not heard much yet regarding commitment,
but hope it may come in time. I am feeling as though I
have a heavy load on my shoulders for a boy, but I hope and pray
for the best to come. I want to see the light, if there is any for
me. I sometimes think that I am forgotten; and then again I know
better, for there is One who never forgets us. I have read those
nice tracts you sent me and they are all true. The boys are all well
and send their best respects to you and hope to meet you again; and
you know I do, for I feel the need of your kindness and appreciate
it highly. I know what a kind mother is. I have a good Christian
mother and father. Oh, if I were only free again, so I could enjoy
life with my dear mother! No one knows how lonely I am. You
are only one hundred miles from my home in &mdash;&mdash;, Illinois. If
you go there you could find them by enquiring for them. They would
be glad to see you, as I have told them about your being here. I
hope some day that you can come and see me on the outside. What
a happy boy I would be! If not, I hope we may meet in that
brighter home. I have been reading my Bible and find relief. What
a book it is, and the good that can be gotten from it! I wish you
success through life and that you may save many a poor lost sinner.
No one knows the good they can do until they try.</p>

<p>
May God bless you, is my prayer.</p>

<h4>SENTENCE COMMUTED.</h4>

<p>Many of those acquainted with the case were anxious
for his release but met with little encouragement. I continued
to pray earnestly that at least his life might be
spared. When the day appointed for his execution came
I was in a distant state some miles from a telegraph office,
but I sent a little boy to the office with a message telling
him that the Lord might even yet deliver him and if not
would sustain him in his dying moments. The same day a
wire came for him from the governor changing his sentence
to imprisonment for life. He was transferred to a
northern prison, but only lived a few years. So far as I
could learn he lived and died a Christian, and I hope to see
him again by and by in heaven.</p>


<h4>A MAN DECEIVED.</h4>

<p>At one time I held a service with the prisoners in the
county jail in Sedalia, Missouri. Among them was a
poor old man awaiting execution. He seemed unmoved,
stolid, indifferent. I talked and prayed with him and asked
him about his soul's salvation. He said it was all right
with his soul and that he was saved. I knew the Lord
showed me that he was a deceived man and that the devil
had deluded him into thinking he was all right. I was
faithful to my convictions, to my God and to his soul. I
said to him: "You are not prepared to face the scaffold
and death." He seemed indignant that I should doubt his
word, but I left him with the warning, "Prepare to meet
thy God."</p>

<p>I went to the wife of the sheriff, who was an excellent
woman, and found she too was very anxious about his soul.
I told her of my burden for him and asked for a room
where I could wait on God in prayer and she kindly furnished
it. In an hour the old man sent word to the sheriff
to send for me to come and pray for him as he was not fit
to die. In company with others I went to him and the
poor deceived old man repented of his sins and confessed
them to God and to us and was blessedly saved and died
in the full assurance of faith. His last words were of his
hope in Christ and of his acceptance with God. I fully believe
that the blood of Jesus&mdash;who died on the cross for
sinners and was the friend of sinners always&mdash;did cleanse
his soul. The sheriff's wife told me of his last words and
that all was well. We give a clipping from a Sedalia paper
concerning the case.</p>

<h4>VISITORS EXCLUDED.</h4>

<blockquote><p class="center">WILLIAMSON WILL RECEIVE NO MORE VISITS&mdash;PREPARATION FOR THE
EXECUTION.</p>

<p>Sheriff Ellis R. Smith has commenced to make his arrangements
for the execution of Thomas A. Williamson, and everything will be
in readiness before Saturday morning. The rope with which John
Oscar Turlington and Bill Price were hanged will be used, the sheriff
having received a telegram yesterday from Sheriff Mat S. Ayers, of
Saline county, stating that it had been forwarded to him by express.
On the day of execution the police force will assist the county
authorities in preserving order in the vicinity of the jail building.</p>

<p>No more visitors will be permitted to see and talk with Williamson,
except his spiritual advisers. This is in compliance with the
condemned man's wishes, which are contained in the following note
which he sent to Sheriff Smith yesterday:</p>

<p>"Sheriff Smith: I would like a cell by myself the rest of my
time. You can put me any place. I will give you no trouble. My
mind is on God. I would like to be upstairs; it is lighter up there.
I will go where you put me.</p>

<p class="signature">
T. A. W."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I received from him the following letters written after
his conversion. One of them reached me after his execution:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Sedalia, Mo.</p>

<p>Sister Elizabeth R. Wheaton:
</p>

<p>I am well this morning. I thank God for it. I hope this will find
you well. I prayed to God to watch over me through the night,
and He did. I feel happy. I will meet you across the river. We
will have a good time. May God keep you. I am going to heaven.
I will meet you in that bright land. I am glad to hear from you.</p>

<h4>INTERCEDED FOR THE LIFE OF A BOY.</h4>

<p>I went to a city in 1898, where there were four under
sentence of death, and when I went into the jail found
many waiting trial. Some were going to state's prison.
Others were to die on the scaffold. I was especially impressed
with the case of one boy who was under death sentence.
I held a service with the prisoners and talked personally
to those condemned to die. One man was wonderfully
saved and I believe went to heaven from the scaffold.
I then went away to other states. But I was so troubled
I made inquiries and found that the young boy to whom I
referred <em>was not charged with being a murderer</em>, and was
not deserving of death. I plead to God if there was nothing
the law could find in him worthy of death, that his sentence
might be commuted, and the poor boy might live.
Upon my return I went to the capital to see the Governor,
and asked him to grant the boy a life sentence in prison.
My request was granted, it was soon all settled and the
boy's life was spared. Yet the Deputy Sheriff was very
angry at the Governor for granting the commutation!</p>


<h4>WENT TO THE SCAFFOLD SINGING.</h4>

<p>In May, 1899, another poor prisoner ended his life on
the scaffold. The Friday before, two died on the same gallows.
I visited them the day before the execution, talked
and sang hymns (their favorites), and then we three
kneeled together in prayer in the little "condemned cell."
Kneeling between my boys, clasping each by the hand, we
gave ourselves to the blessed Savior, who said just before
he expired on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do." I shall never forget that last
prayer meeting with those unfortunate men who had been
led astray by evil surroundings and associations, forming
habits which finally sent them to early graves, by fearful
deaths. Yet, as we knelt there together, just we three and
the blessed Holy Spirit witnessing, we promised to meet
in Heaven. Jesus met us there and forgave them their
sins, and joy filled our souls with love for Him who gave
Himself a ransom for us, not willing that any should perish,
but rather that all should have eternal life. How my heart
rejoiced to hear them say they were prepared to go, and
the parting was very sweet. A solemn hush filled the little
cell&mdash;sweet peace which only comes when souls have been
redeemed, fell upon my heart, and I was glad Jesus Himself
did His own work for His own name's honor and
glory. They sang hymns and prayed all night before the
execution. They refused to eat, preferring to sing and
pray till the last, and went to the scaffold singing and
praising God, and were still singing when the drop fell,
and they were gone from earth.</p>

<p>My heart cried out for the living that May morning, as
another one went to the scaffold, "O God, save his soul! O
God, forgive him all his sins. The same scaffold, the same
sin, and the same Jesus to blot out all his transgressions."
I believe God, where he says, Isa. 1:18, "Though your sins
be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow: though they
be red like crimson they shall be as wool." If it were not
for the promises of God in His blessed Word, I should give
up in despair, sometimes, over those cases who have been
so deceived by the devil. Yet God is able to snatch them as
brands from the burning. Jude 22-23 says, "And of some
have compassion, making a difference: and others save with
fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment
spotted by the flesh." Jesus said, "Whosoever will may
come," I believe His promises are "Yea and amen to all
that believe." When I see what saloons and other evils are
doing to wreck lives and ruin souls, I wonder how God
on His throne can ever forgive such premeditated, intentional
sins. The keepers of these places sell themselves to
Satan to be used by him to defeat God's plan of saving
those who will come unto Him. O that all who claim to be
Christians would unite to overthrow the means that Satan
uses to lead down to eternal death so many precious souls!</p>

<p>The case to which I shall now refer was one in many
respects especially touching. The condemned man had occupied
<em>a prominent official position</em>. The dear, noble
wife never turned away from her husband. Hers were
the kind heart and hands that ministered to his needs and
cheered the long, gloomy hours of his imprisonment. She
stood by him in his trial and during those days of agony
and suspense. Then came the verdict "Guilty," and the
sentence of death! Yet, though her own heart was breaking
as she thought of herself and her beautiful, helpless
children, she still sought to cheer and comfort as best she
could that poor condemned man whose heart was torn with
anguish when he realized that because of his sin that faithful
loving wife and those innocent children must be left disgraced
and destitute. What is to become of the little ones
who are powerless to help themselves and of the poor despised,
rejected, forsaken mother, trying to earn with her
own hands by toiling night and day enough to feed and
clothe those helpless babes? O my God, will you not help
me to provide a home for such as these? For the sake of
these heart-broken mothers whose lives are doomed to be
(only as helped by the grace of God) one great unending
sorrow&mdash;for the sake of the poor children so cruelly robbed
of their birthright&mdash;a father's good name and protection,
these who are worse than orphans, yet for whom nobody
seems to care, help me to do what I can&mdash;what thou dost
require at my hands. This man was brought up in a Christian
home and but for the power of evil associations with
which he was brought in contact and the curse of the legalized
saloon, would today in all probability have been a respected
and honorable member of society.</p>

<p>I first found him one Fourth of July. While others were
spending the holiday I went toiling through the heat to the
prison and there I found my reward. My soul was borne
upward by the Holy Spirit as I sang many songs of praise
and tenderly led this poor man to the foot of the cross where
he was saved. His wife was there a part of the time. I
seem to see the parting even now of those dear ones! Well,
God knows it all. Had I never known a wife's and a
mother's love I could not have sympathized with them as
I did. I thought&mdash;What if <em>my</em> boy had lived and come to
such an end&mdash;and I wept with that faithful wife as she took
leave. O, sisters, there is a power in even a look of love
coming from a true heart.</p>

<p>I give two letters received from the condemned man and
one written me by his wife. I omit the name of place and
exact date and even the initials, as so few years have passed
and I do not wish to do anything that might bring pain to
the hearts of surviving friends. The family was of the most
cultured and respected.</p>

<p>Dear Sister Wheaton:
</p>

<p>It was with the greatest pleasure that I read your card this morning.
I was wondering where you were; but I knew that if your
health permitted you, you were somewhere doing good to some poor
unfortunate.</p>

<p>Yes, I am putting my entire trust in Jesus. He saves me from
my sins and when the cares and woes of this life come to disturb
my peace, I look unto the Savior and soon all is peace again. What
would I do in a place like this and under such circumstances did
not his gentle voice speak unto me and say, "Fear not, I will not
leave nor forsake you." My wife was down to see me last Monday,
and is coming today (Thursday). She wrote me that your
songs and prayer were still ringing in her ears&mdash;so you see that your
good work is not only felt by prisoners. I hope that you may be
able to go on with the good work that so much delights you and
that you may yet win many wandering souls and bring them into
the fold of God and that when your work on earth is ended you may
rest from your labors in the most beautiful palace in the city of
heaven. You may think that strange that I said "palace," but I
believe that heaven is a real and tangible city&mdash;the home of God,
from where He sends the Holy Ghost to dwell in the hearts of all
those who are willing to receive Him.</p>

<p>I will now say good-by, and if I never again meet you on this
earth, I hope to meet you in heaven.</p>

<p>I am yours most sincerely in the hope of heaven.</p>

<p>My Dear Mother, for such you seem to me, I will never while I am
on this earth cease to think of you. I have remembered your voice
since I first heard you sing and pray while in the cells of poor W&mdash;&mdash;
and S&mdash;&mdash;, the condemned men. I wished then that I could have
seen you, and I told the boys that you were certainly born of God;
and from that day I have desired to have your influence and prayers.
I am still trusting in the love, mercy and power of the Savior to
save my soul in the eternal world and to keep me from sin while I
am in this. I have no other hope, no other desire than to serve my
Master. I would want to attain to a state of perfection here, if
such were possible, but you know that the cares of this life come in
to rob us of the pleasure that we would enjoy in the anticipation of
heaven. But some day the dark clouds that overshadow us and
prevent us for a while from seeing the Savior's smiling face will be
rolled away. I am glad to tell you that the sentence of R&mdash;&mdash;,
whose cell was next to mine, has been commuted to life imprisonment.
He and the man P&mdash;&mdash; send their regards to you. P&mdash;&mdash;'s sentence
is respited until the 17th of November, and in the meantime he hopes
for a new trial.</p>

<p>The following from the <cite>Star</cite> of &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, explains
itself. The men are referred to in the above letter:</p>

<h4>BOTH TWICE CONVICTED OF THE CRIME OF MURDER.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Everything is in readiness at the District jail for the double execution
which is to take place tomorrow, when S&mdash;&mdash; and W&mdash;&mdash; will
pay the penalty of their crimes. So far as outward appearances
are concerned, the condemned men are in a better frame of mind
than are most of the other prisoners in the big brown-stone prison.
Their spiritual advisers are with them most of the time, and when
they are absent the men pass the hours reading religious books and
praying.</p>

<p>S&mdash;&mdash; and W&mdash;&mdash; have both been well-behaved prisoners and have
given the jail officials no trouble whatever. The former has been
particularly friendly with the guards and others, and today he
thanked several of them for past kindnesses. He also desired to
express his gratitude to his many friends for what they had done for
him, and said he desired to do so through the <cite>Star</cite>. S&mdash;&mdash; has had
many visitors during the entire time of his confinement in jail, but
more especially during recent weeks. Most of them have been female
relatives. They have been endeavoring to collect funds enough to
defray the expenses of a decent burial. In the event of their being
successful the body will be turned over to them after the execution
by the undertaker employed by the government to prepare the
bodies for burial.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon, just before the prison doors were locked for the
day, the bell rang and the guard at the door admitted a woman who
handed in her card on which was printed:</p>

<p class="center">
"Elizabeth Rider Wheaton,<br />
"Prison Evangelist.<br />
"No Home but Heaven."
</p>

<p>She had with her a number of tracts which she distributed to some
of the prisoners. Her religious work is all done in prisons, and she
makes a specialty of laboring with condemned men. She stated to
the guards that she had traveled about 2,000 miles to see those in
jail here before their execution. The warden admitted her to the
cells. She had W&mdash;&mdash; and S&mdash;&mdash; join her in prayer and song in the
latter's cell, and the men seemed greatly to appreciate her hour's
visit. She next saw E&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash;, who is to die on the scaffold next
week. He, too, appeared to enjoy her call.</p>

</p>

<p>My Dear Sister: I must write a few lines to you, in my husband's
letter, as you have shown yourself so kind to him, poor fellow. I
can see you now and hear you, in my fancy, singing those beautiful
pieces. Oh, how sad I felt on that Fourth of July as I sat and listened,
especially to the one called "Some Mother's Child," as I
looked upon my dear husband and thought of his mother and how
tenderly he had been reared by Christian parents, and was always a
good and thoughtful son and husband until by reason of evil associations
he fell into sin and kept going further and further from
God until at last he was led to do the most dreadful of deeds. How
I pity him!</p>

<p>O how happy I once was! Had a pretty home and everything to
brighten it. But alas, they have vanished and now I feel alone,
without anything. Did I say "alone?" No, not so, for the God
that I have served and who has been with me these twenty years, is
still with me; and I feel to say, "Though he slay me, yet will I
trust him." I feel that he will open up a way for his children.
Now, my dear sister, I would love to see you again in this life and
talk with you, but if I never meet you here I trust I shall meet you
above, where your voice will be heard with the angels of God. Please
remember me to your lady helper. Would be glad to hear from you
at any time. Good-bye.</p>

<p>Two years later, while in the same city, a friend invited
me to go to an open-air service and after I had sung and
spoken to those who were gathered a dear lady clasped my
hand and said: "I am so glad to see you, mother&mdash;don't you
know me?" As I failed to recognize her she turned her
careworn but lovely face so that the electric light shone
full upon her and said, "Don't you remember me now?"
When I still answered "No, I do not," the tears gathered
in the dear eyes as she said, "My husband never forgot your
singing and your prayers before he went away," and then it
dawned upon me that she was the wife of the man the people
hung to gratify the saloon men's greed. She said: "I
do wish I could ask you home with me, but I have only a
little hall room for myself and children. I am keeping
boarders to make a living for myself and them." O how I
wished for a home to which I could welcome them, but I,
too, am a pilgrim and a stranger, and all I could do was to
kiss the dear sister and commend her to the widow's God
and her dear ones to the Father of the fatherless.</p>

<p>The letters following are from two brothers with whom
I labored, and who showed much appreciation of my efforts
with them and professed to be saved. I received a number
of encouraging letters from them and from others in the
same place before they were taken away. We can not
always tell as to the sincerity of these poor men, or of their
responsibility, some of them doubtless are so nearly unbalanced
in mind, under such a strain, but we know the God
of heaven before whom we must all stand will judge righteously.</p>

<h4>THREE YOUNG MEN.</h4>

<p>Some cases of special interest to me because of such recent
occurrence, are the three young men mentioned elsewhere

they were awaiting some decision of the supreme court:</p>

<p>Dear Mother: I have not answered your postal on account of my
absence from the city, but I hope you will overlook the delay. The
fate of the four prisoners under sentence of death is still undecided,
as their case is in the hands of the Supreme Court. There is some
doubt as to the legality of the law and it is a hard matter to tell
what the outcome will be. No, my folks did not attend the Prison
Congress this year on account of my sister's health. The boys at
the prison often speak of you and some have started to forget the
past and try to do better in the future on account of the good words
you spoke to them. I hope you will come to see us before my father
goes out of office, but if this is impossible, I pray that we may
meet at some future time. I remain,</p>

<p>Mrs. E. R. Wheaton.
</p>

<p>My Dear Mother: I received your kind letter and was very much
pleased to hear from you, as all of us were. * * *</p>

<p>When I saw and read your letter and those little tracts, they certainly
did take effect on me. As I read them and saw the terrible
mistake I had made, it caused the tears to fall. I am trusting in
God, but I can't come right out and tell you that I am really saved,
for I don't believe in deceiving you. But I do believe that God has
laid a hand on me, and I hope He will take a stronger hold on me.
I know you will think more of me for telling you the candid facts.
I have seen lots of people who would tell that they were really saved,
when they knew they were not. But "God help my poor soul," is
my regular prayer. I realize that I need His help in my present
circumstances. I still ask you to pray for me that God will help me
to look to Him. I try my best to do what is right, and never go to
sleep a night without praying to Him to save my soul and spare me
so that I may be of some benefit to His cause, and I do fully believe
that He will answer my prayer, for when I pray I am sure I do it
with all my heart and soul.</p>

<p>I am quite well at present, and hope that these few lines will find
you the same. May God bless you and protect you, is my daily
prayer. I hope to hear from you again soon.</p>

<p>From one of yours, and I hope, the Lord's sons.</p>

<p>Dear Mother Wheaton:
</p>

<p>We received your card and were indeed glad to hear from you.
Oh, I am praying to God all the time to spare my baby's life.
How can I ever live if they take his life! Why do they want it?
He did not kill any one, although the deed he did almost breaks
my heart. F. never drank until he got with those people on
Market Street. They got him to smoking hop and drinking
whiskey. My dear and only child, will God and man have mercy
on him? Oh, I thank you for going to see my poor baby boy!
God bless him and save his life.</p>

<p>I hope you can see the Governor and see if he will do something
for a mother to save her only child. I can hardly stand it. It
has done F. so much good for you to see him. He always speaks
of you when he writes home. Oh, I do hope the Governor will
give you some hopes, for if I could get any hopes of F. being
spared it would do me so much good! I pray day and night for my
boy. He is on my mind all the time. Hoping to hear from you

are going to see my dear husband soon. I hope it will not be
long till I see him, for it seems like years since I have seen poor
F. I hope my loved one will come out better yet, for I can never
stand it. I hope and pray that F. will have a show for his life.
How short our young lives were together. F. was always kind to
me and it almost took my life when I was robbed of my darling
husband. I was an orphan girl. My dear mother died when I was
five years old. I had a hard time all my life till I was eighteen,
when I was married to F., last September. I was so happy with
him. He was a good boy and never drank till he met with the
Market Street gang and they got him to drinking and smoking
that hop.</p>

<p>This is the Fourth of July and F.'s gray-haired mother and I
are here grieving over the loved one in prison. If a wife ever
loved a husband truly I love mine. I remain your friend,</p>

Oh, it is terrible; it seems too hard for me to stand. Just think,
my only darling child. But I know he is in heaven. He died on
the 16th. We went to see him and he was so glad to see us. He
kissed his papa and all of us and said he wanted us not to grieve
any more than we could help.... His last words were
"Good-bye, mamma," with a smile and wave of his hand just
like I was coming back again. He said he would like to be
buried close to home. Poor, darling boy; he loved to be close to
home and mamma in life, but it is hard to think that he had to

<p class="center">(The above was from the aged mother and the young wife.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Think you, dear reader, that these experiences are passed
by lightly when I must enter into the sorrows of these
mothers and loved ones who must give up their dear ones
in this way? Only the grace and love of God can sustain
me and these dear bereaved ones in these trials. This was
one of my saddest experiences, as I was personally acquainted
with the parents and the dear young wife of one
of these young men, having been entertained at their home
some days at a time during their sorrow. This is only another
example of what strong drink is doing in our land.
God pity those who in the least favor this traffic.</p>

<p>I give below short extracts taken from <cite>The Daily News</cite>
of Denver concerning these cases:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Not yet has the final word for F. A., C. P. and N. A., under
sentence of death, been said.</p>

<p>"It is likely that it will not be said for at least a week or ten
days. The Board of Pardons adjourned late yesterday afternoon
without deciding the fate of the three boys....</p>

<p>"But, though the tragic element was lacking, there was present
throughout the meeting an undercurrent of deep human woe.
The mother of A. was there, clad in black, with a hopeless expression
on her face pitiful to see. Beside her at all times was the
wife of A., young, pretty in an indefinite sort of way, her blue
eyes holding ever before them the wreck of her shattered girlish
romance. Both women wept freely at times.</p>

<p>"With the two women were a dozen of their women friends,
whose coming had been actuated by a mixture of curiosity and
sympathy.</p></blockquote>


<h4>FRIEND OF ALL PRISONERS.</h4>

<blockquote><p>"Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton, friend of prisoners the world over,
was there too. She sat next Mrs. A., the elder, and wept copiously
in sympathy. 'Mother' Wheaton visited the boys at Canon
City, and she told the board the impression of her visit, how,
she was sure, they had repented of their deed and had their sins
forgiven.</p>

<p>"She also pleaded for their lives on the ground of opposition
to capital punishment. She has been in state prison rescue work
for twenty-one years, and her silver hair, refined face and gentle
manner have brought comfort to criminals everywhere."&mdash;News,
May 6.</p></blockquote>


<h4>SESSION OF THE BOARD.</h4>

<blockquote><p>The Board of Pardons met in special session at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning for the purpose of passing finally upon the applications
of the three boys for commutation of sentence from death to imprisonment
for life.</p>

<p>Interest in the proceedings of the morning centered around four
women, two mothers, a sister and a wife of the condemned boys.
They were Mrs. J. A., bowed with the weight of her seventy
years, who had come all the way from Buffalo, N. Y., to be present
at the meeting; her daughter, Miss A., of Denver; Mrs. J. A.
and Mrs. F. A., mother and wife, respectively, of F. A. All four
were present throughout the hearing and made personal pleas to
the Board.</p>

<p>After the hearing was concluded they went together into the
outer office of the executive chamber and sat huddled up in one
corner of the big room, their eyes fixed on the door which led to
the inner office where four men were deciding whether the boys
they loved should live or die.</p></blockquote>


<h4>HEARD THE BAD NEWS.</h4>

<blockquote><p>When the news of the Board's action was conveyed by Secretary
C. E. Hagar to the four women waiting in the outer office,
their grief was pitiful in the extreme. Mrs. A. very nearly collapsed.
She clung to the arm of her daughter and moaned in heart-breaking
accents. The daughter, too, was almost overcome, but
controlled herself for her mother's sake.</p>

<p>The mother and wife of F. A., while it was evident they were
suffering keenly, maintained an outward composure except for the
tears which welled from their eyes. They hurriedly left the capitol
building together. The young wife will go to the penitentiary
Friday to say a last good-bye to her husband.</p></blockquote>


<h4>PLEA OF ATTORNEY.</h4>

<blockquote><p>W. E., attorney for A., made a wonderfully eloquent plea for his
client's life. It was logical, pathetic and at times scathing in its
denunciation of the methods used by the police to extort confessions
from the boys. He said these methods, in their horrible brutality,
were without parallel anywhere.</p>

<p>"The only evidence upon which N. A. was convicted," he said,
"was the alleged confession wrung out of him by police brutality.
This confession was made after the prisoner had been 'sweated'
and intimidated. One ear had been almost torn off, he had been
cuffed, kicked and trampled upon, and then, under the influence of
threats, he made his alleged confession."</p></blockquote>


<h4>NEWS THAT SON IS TO HANG BROKEN TO AGED WOMAN BY HER DAUGHTER
AND CAUSES COLLAPSE.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Sitting and staring with a blank look into space, at intervals
relieving the tension of her misery by low moans, and then again
ejaculating pitifully, "Oh, my boy! My poor, poor boy! Can I
live and know that you died upon the gallows?" Mrs. J. A. is
now hovering on the borderland of life at the home of her daughter
in Denver.</p>

<p>It was not until noon yesterday that Mrs. A. was told that the
pardons board had refused to grant her son, N. A., a commutation
of sentence from death to life imprisonment. Up to that moment
when the terrible knowledge became hers she had a mother's
hope that the pardons board must save her boy. From the moment
she heard from her daughter's lips that the son and brother
must die, Mrs. A. has been verging upon a semi-comatose condition,
and under the constant care of a physician.</p>

<p>She was illy prepared to hear the news yesterday, for she had
spent the night previous without closing her eyes in sleep. It
was not until 5 o'clock that slumber came to her mercifully, and
even then she merely slept in a fitful doze until 8 o'clock.</p></blockquote>


<h4>SUPPRESSED EMOTION.</h4>

<blockquote><p>The serious phase of Mrs. A.'s condition, her physician regards,
is that with her it is all suppressed emotion. She does not cry
out or rave, but endures her intense suffering in quiet. It is but
seldom that tears come to her relief, and the only vent her emotion
has is in her low moans for her "poor boy."</p>

<p>After the news was broken to her, Mrs. A. spent most of the day
in bed. Late last night she was still in the same condition, and
the gravest anxiety is felt by her relatives.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. is 70 years old. She lives in Buffalo, N. Y., and made
the long trip of 1,500 miles to personally plead with the State
Board of Pardons for the life of her son.</p></blockquote>


<h4>TO TEST GALLOWS.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Warden C. will today test the automatic scaffold upon which
N. A. and F. A. will be executed next week. He will see that
everything about the device is in perfect order and will make a
final test just prior to taking the first of the two to his death.
The execution house, where the men will be confined until the final
summons, is 28x30 feet. It contains three condemned cells and
across the hall from these are two large rooms. In the center of
one is a large iron plate and on this the condemned is asked to
stand after the noose and cap have been adjusted. The weight of
the man causes the plate to drop about an inch. This closes the
circuit of a current connecting with a bucket of water which
stands on a shelf in a closet in an adjoining room. By a magnet
arrangement a plug in the bottom of the bucket is pulled and the
water begins to flow out. As soon as the vessel is empty an automatic
connection releases a catch holding a bag of sand on the
end of the noose.</p>

<p>The sand, being heavier than the man, falls, causing the body
at the other extremity of the rope to be jerked off the floor to the
height of three feet. The sandbag is in the room containing the
closet where the bucket is and the rope from the noose reaches
that room over a pulley and through a hole in the wall.</p>

<p>The condemned man does not see any of the details of the execution
when he enters the death cell. The iron plate in the floor
and the noose around his neck are the only parts he can see. He
does not hear the dropping of the water nor the working of any
of the mechanism.</p>

<p>The instant the man is jerked off his feet and suspended at the
end of the rope his neck is broken. The time intervening between
the pulling of the plug in the bucket and the falling of the sand is
usually about a minute. The suspense to the prisoner, however, is
not regarded as any more cruel than that experienced by a man
in the electrical chair or on the scaffold while he awaits the fatal
current or the springing of the trap.</p>

<p>The hanging apparatus was invented by a convict fifteen years
ago.&mdash;<cite>News</cite>, May 20.</p></blockquote>

<p>As shown by foregoing letters these cases were continued
till June 16. Such is the suspense, sorrow of heart and
grief through which many are constantly passing in this
world, all on account of sin. What are we trying to do to
lend a hand of relief?</p>

<p>Such, dear reader, are a few of the many, many cases of
this class with which I have had to do in these more than
twenty years of ministry to those that are bound. Some
were hardened criminals, others innocent of the crime for
which they were condemned and others no more guilty than
thousands that the world honors. For all, Christ died; and
many others beside these I have mentioned have given
evidence of saving faith in the blood that is able to cleanse
the deepest stain that sin has made.</p>

<p>One case is just as near and dear to my mother heart as
another and yet how different in many respects are these
condemned men&mdash;different in their natural inclinations and
unlike because of their different circumstances in life.
Among them are found the refined, the educated, the gifted,
the beautiful as well as the low, the ignorant, the degraded.
All must share the same fate. All are shown in the worst
possible light to a gaping, sensation-loving, curious world.
Let us, dear reader, take these cases home to our hearts as if
they were our very own and so learn to have that charity
that suffereth long and is kind. Even Moses and David took
life, yet they were forgiven, and Moses who in haste slew
the Egyptian, became the prophet so wonderfully used of
God because of his meekness of spirit; and David in his
thankfulness declared, "This poor man cried and the Lord
heard him and delivered him out of all his troubles."</p>

<h3>Work in Churches and Missions.</h3>


<p>As stated in preface I have always as opportunity offered
been ready to preach the gospel to all men. In this chapter
I speak very briefly of some of the work done in churches
and missions and give some letters from pastors and friends
referring to this part of my labors.</p>


<h4>STRANGELY LED.</h4>

<p>I once had a young sister with me whom I had taken
from Toronto, Canada. I had told her mother I would return
her safely and had given her money to pay her fare
home. As we returned through a field to the city from the
poor farm where I had held a service, I said to the sister,
"I am so hungry." She replied, "O wait till we get to
heaven, then we shall have of the twelve manner of fruit,
and drink of the water of life," and I was cheered and blest
as I went along the way. The Lord showed me to trust
Him. When I reached my lodging-house I was so weak
and tired that I sat down to rest a few moments before
ascending the stairs to my room. The landlady sat by her
well-filled table after the boarders were all gone. She asked
the servant for a plate, and I watched her while she cut off
a nice piece of turkey and a piece of roast beef and then put
some bread on the plate and handed it to me. I was, O, so
glad, but feared she was going to ask pay for it, and I had
only a dime. I asked, "How much is this?" and she replied,
"Nothing." I was so overcome with gratitude to God
for His goodness that I hastened to my room and thanked
God for answering prayer, in giving me food I needed to
give me strength for the meeting that afternoon on the
street, and in the evening at the colored people's church. At
the close of the meeting in the evening the preacher said:
"The sister has given us a good sermon, and the gospel must
be carried, so come up and give us a good collection." The
people responded heartily and gave a very liberal collection,
but after the meeting the preacher handed me 25 cents,
keeping the rest. I felt very badly as I had prayed for
money which I needed so much. I must go to another city,
and no money for traveling expenses. I had been obliged
to have some work done by the dentist which must be paid,
and no money, but I kept believing, yet no open heart or
door. I wondered why I was led to go to another place
with no means provided. When I had gotten the amount
needed I left, heart-sick, lonely and weary to go on alone
in the work, and the sister to go home to Canada. A few
days later I was walking along the streets of Lynchburg,
Va. I met a man who said, "I am Rev. B&mdash;&mdash; from
Chicago. I have met you several times in your work. Sister
Wheaton, won't you come with me to church?" I said,
"Where?" and he said, "To the First Baptist church."</p>

<p>When we entered the beautiful new church building the
evangelist introduced me to the young pastor, who hurried
by indifferently. He then presented me to some fine looking
ladies who also passed by on the other side. When the evangelist
had closed his sermon he said, "Now, friends, this is
the lady I told you about who has done more good than we
preachers. I know her, but she don't know me. Receive
her as a sister. She is worthy." When the service closed,
one after another came to speak to me and gave me their
hand and invited me to their homes. A gentleman and
wife came up and said, "We claim you as our guest." The
husband said, "The carriage is at the door. I will walk and
you may ride with my wife." I was at a loss to know just
which invitation to accept, when the evangelist came up
and said, "These are the people for you to go with." I did
so and the Lord went with me. I was invited to preach that
night and the Lord was there in mighty convicting power.
At the close of the meeting the evangelist said, "Sister, how
did it happen that I met you just as I did this morning?"
I said, "Brother B., things don't happen with me. The
Lord sent me to this place."</p>

<p>The next day a young lady called at the house and inquired
for me. I went to the door and she handed me a
small parcel saying, "Your friends from the First Baptist
church sent you this." Thanking her I went inside and
found it was fifteen dollars.</p>

<p>I was the guest of one of the F. F. V.'s, so was welcomed
everywhere. Other churches and other preachers invited me
to their pulpits. In a few days Mrs. Col. O. asked me if I
would conduct a meeting for women only at the M. E.
church if she would arrange for it. I was impressed that
the thought was of God and agreed to do so. The meeting
was appointed for Wednesday at 4 p. m. On the way to
the church I was so burdened with the responsibility of the
meeting that I told the sister (the kind friend who entertained
me) that I could not talk, I must pray the rest of the
way to church. To my surprise the place became crowded.
I had expected perhaps a dozen women and no men; and
here the place was full of elegantly dressed ladies, and the
pastor of the church, Brother H., and a policeman were also
present. I tried to proceed with the service, but seemed
unable to do so. After prayer and singing, "How firm a
foundation," I arose and said: "Is any one led of the Spirit
to give me a text. I have no message." A sister arose and
timidly said, "The 14th chapter of John." Well, the flood
gates of Heaven were opened to my soul. God spoke and
waves of salvation rolled over the church, and women, God
bless them! arose and said, "I thought I was a Christian until
today, but I find I have never begun to serve the Lord yet.
I promise, by God's help, to begin anew today for Heaven."
The dear Lord touched proud hearts and melted them together
until the place was filled with the glory of God. The
pastor and people asked me to hold another meeting the following
day for both men and women. I said I would do so
in the fear of the Lord, and the Lord wonderfully blessed
the services. Souls were brought in touch with God and
saved. I said to them, "Friends, begin a revival at once.
God is ready to work with you if you follow Him. My
services are ended in this church. The prisoners, my special
care, need me, and the poor and the colored people." I remained
three weeks in that city, wonderfully blessed of God.
When I left there were over fifty dollars in my hand, of free
will offerings. I see why the Lord sent me to the city to
arouse the sleeping church members and preachers, both
white and colored, from their cold, lifeless spiritual condition.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Lynchburg I received the following
letter from the sister who planned the meeting, which greatly
encouraged me:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Lynchburg, May 2, 1887.</p>

<p>My Dear Sister:
</p>

<p>I received your letter several days since. I am truly rejoiced to
know that you receive that peace and comfort which a child of
God knows to be her portion.</p>

<p>My thoughts have followed you since your departure from our
city and prayers from many hearts have ascended to the throne
for your safety and success in the great work God has called you
to do.</p>

<p>I have not known of a revival such as is now in progress at Dr.
Hannon's church. Men and women are flocking to the meetings,
old and young, to know what they must do to be saved. My son
was happily converted last Friday night. He had long been cold
and indifferent, but now all is joy and he works and speaks for
God with willingness. He is in solemn earnest now in working,
praying and speaking in the great congregation. Surely goodness
and mercy have followed me all the days of my life and I will
dwell at the feet of my Master forever.</p>

<p>Though God has sent tears to my eyes and grief to my heart,
thanks to His dear name He has kept me from falling. I think
you left a good influence among the fallen women here. I have
been sent for to go to some since you left. I have sent this day
a request to the official board of my church to give me the use
of one room in the church where I can always meet them for the
purpose of hearing of their desires to lead a new life. In this way
my pastor can meet them and help me in this work. I await the
result.</p>

<p>I went on my way, and some time after was in San
Francisco, California. Hearing one day, as I left the jail,
of a holiness convention, I was impressed to attend. When
I arrived a testimony meeting was in progress. I arose
and began to sing, "Yes, I will stand up for Jesus," and
the minister in charge came down the aisle to me and said:
"Is this Sister Wheaton who held meetings in my church
in L&mdash;&mdash;, Va.?" I said, "My name is Elizabeth Wheaton,
and I held meetings in that city. Are you Dr. H.?"
and he said, "Yes." He returned to the platform and told
the people of my work in his church and that about four
hundred had been saved, and told the people to receive me
as a child of God. So homes were opened. The work of
God moved on. As I was a stranger in a strange city, I
blessed God for the leadings of the Holy Spirit in all my
pilgrim way. I have not seen Dr. H. since that time. He
gave me a pressing invitation to his church in San Francisco
but work on other lines prevented my acceptance.</p>

<p>My Dear Sister:
</p>

<p>It would be impossible for me to express in words the Christian
sympathy and love I have for you&mdash;one that has left all;
yes, all&mdash;denying yourself and taking up the cross of Jesus, carrying
the glad tidings of salvation to the despised, to the outcast,
to the poor in spirit and to the oppressed. I pray daily that the
good Lord may bless you.</p>

<p>Dear sister, those in the world whose minds are carnal, cannot
understand your work, for your life is hidden in God, and cannot
be discerned in any other way but by the Spirit. Our crosses will
soon be over. Jesus will not let us suffer for Him long. He is
coming for us soon. Then "Be not weary in well-doing, for in
due season we shall reap, if we faint not." We are not the
only friends you have in Wetumpka. Long will you live in our
memory. I pray that the Lord may ever guide and lead you as
He knows and sees best. I am your brother in Christ,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wheaton, Famous Prison Evangelist, "Led by the Lord
Here"&mdash;Her Faith in This Absolute&mdash;Opens Interview
with Prayer&mdash;Large Audiences Hear Her.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton is in town and last night and
yesterday afternoon addressed a large audience at the revival
services which Rev. Mr. Cooper, of St. Paul's M. E. church is conducting
in a tent situated near his church, on Walton avenue. She
reached this city Saturday evening over the Pennsylvania. Having
missed a train at Warsaw en route to visit a sister who lives
at Elkhart, she was directed, she said by the Lord, after prayer,
to come to Fort Wayne to spend the Sabbath. On the way over
her singing and praying on the train attracted attention to her and
a member of the Wayne Street Methodist Church, on learning
who she was, invited her and her sister, Mrs. Hoffman, to spend
the night at his home. She had heard, she said, of the meetings
that Mr. Cooper is conducting, and she said, with a manner of
absolute confidence, that she had been directed to attend these
meetings. Rev. Mr. Cooper said yesterday that the meeting was
in progress as she and her companion entered and that he was
impressed to speak to her. On learning her name he knew her
instantly by fame as the widely traveled and much beloved prison
evangelist. She was given a welcome and was at once asked to
participate in the services. At the night meeting there were a
thousand people, it is said, who listened enrapt to her prayers
and moving appeals to the sinner to accept the salvation in which
she so thoroughly believes.</p>

<p>The prisoners at the jail were her first concern Sunday morning.
She told Mr. Cooper that after arising she turned to her
Bible for guidance and her eyes fell upon certain Scripture which
contained the word prison three times. She took this as evidence
that she should first visit the jail and thither she went. It is
quickly apprehended by those who come in contact with her that
she pauses not when directed, as she believes, to do a service in the
cause of the Master, but goes at once. She has no questionings of
faith.</p>

<p>A Gazette reporter found her last night at the home of Mr.
Bower, No. 136 Walton avenue. Her physical appearance marks
her as no ordinary person. Her face beams with a kindly smile,
being plump and fresh with the vigor of apparent health, though
gray hair indicates her past the prime of life. She dresses modestly
in black and carries with her a satchel in which she keeps
a Testament, her pass holder and some tracts. Her handshake is
a model of firmness and heartiness, conveying the impress of intense
earnestness. Before permitting the interviewer to proceed
further than the salutations, Mrs. Wheaton kneeled and prayed
for the Lord's blessing upon the interview. This unconventional
prelude was novel in the experience of the reporter, but coming
from such a woman seemed perfectly in place. There is reverence
and piety proclaimed by her presence and no thought of incongruity
obtruded. The prayer took the range of ready invocation
and communion with the Lord, and as is probably the evangelist's
wont, the prisoner and the fallen woman were not forgotten in her
petition to the throne of grace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton was not inclined to talk about herself. "What
has been done by me," she said, "was done of the Lord&mdash;His be
the glory. I was called to this work thirteen years ago, and I
walk by His guidance. I have never asked and could not accept a
salary. I have never had a collection taken for me. It is a wonderful
thing how He has led me. Here are some of the railroad
passes that have been given me."</p>

<p>And here she unrolled a leathern holder full of passes from all
the leading roads. Some were "Account of Missionary Work"
and some "Account of Christian Work." It is evident that she
has traveled this country over, and her ministrations have also extended
to the old world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton again attended the services last night, and
moved all by her stirring words. Many could not repress the tears.
Her address was not anchored to a formal text, but was a strong
appeal, nevertheless, to the sinner to repent. The audience was
slow to pass out after the meeting, being anxious to meet the
speaker.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following from Bro. Snyder and his estimable wife
who are my very dear friends and whose home is always
open to me when I am in Baltimore, are very much prized.
They explain themselves. Their work for God and souls
is very exceptional:</p>

<blockquote><p>During the winter of 1894, Mother Wheaton was conducting a
service at the state prison, when one of our men expressed his desire
that she should attend our services. This was my first introduction
to this noble child of God, and since then she seldom comes East
without visiting our church; we all love her, but she rarely stays
over a day at one time, as her work calls her away.</p>

<p>In 1898, we induced her to remain with us a week. At this meeting
hundreds of people attended and many souls were saved. One
of the wealthiest ladies of the church received her pentecost and is
now one of our best workers. During the day Mother Wheaton would
visit the outcast of the city. I recall a case of an old colored woman
that we found in a miserable hovel, dying without Christ; how, after
preparing the room and then praying to Father for the body, she
seemed to be brought back to life by the prayers of God's saint
that she might be led to Christ, and after she gave her life to Him
we administered the Lord's supper. Mother Wheaton has always
been a blessing, whenever she has come to my church; good people
are made better, bad people made good.</p>

<p>The church was dedicated to God by "Mother Wheaton" before
it was finished; while the building was in course of erection she paid
us a short visit; with the moon shining through the open windows,
mortar, bricks, etc., around us, she was prompted to take the church
to God in prayer. I will never forget the scene. Thousands have
been saved and many sanctified. The work is still spreading.</p></blockquote>

<h4>SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS.</h4>

<p>During the early years of my mission work I arrived one
day alone in a Southern city. Went to the postoffice and
was reading my mail when a good old man stepped up and
inquired who I was and where I stopped. I told him I had
just arrived. He said, "Come home with me. My wife
has a room and a home for good women like you." I was
praying for an open door. Did not know where I was going
to stay over night, but was sure God had sent me to
that place. I found them kind, hospitable people. He was
an old-fashioned Methodist preacher already superannuated,
and he has long since gone to his reward. He sent for the
pastor of their church and arranged for me to hold a meeting.
I went at the request of the pastor to visit an old lady
who was sick; thought best to have an open air meeting on
the street and invite people to the church that night. During
the service on the street I noticed a very well dressed,
fine looking young man. When I closed he came to me and
taking my hand asked me to call at his store a few doors
away. I did so and he gave me a fountain pen and seemed
unusually interested in what I had said.</p>

<p>The meeting that night was led by the Holy Spirit; souls
were saved, Christians quickened into new spiritual life and
power, and sinners awakened. Other services were held in
several of the churches. God was honored and the Holy
Spirit held right-of-way. Often I would have services in
the white people's church till 9 p. m., then hurry to the
colored people's church and preach and sing and pray till
11 o'clock. Then at 5 in the morning would meet again,
at the Methodist church, such crowds of worshipers&mdash;devout,
humble seekers after God. I left the city just as the
meetings were at their height. In the next world when we
all assemble together I expect to see many who were converted
at that series of meetings.</p>


<h4>CALLED TO THE MINISTRY.</h4>

<p>The young man who seemed so interested in that first
street service came to all the meetings. He was clearly
converted and was called to the ministry. For some time he
was a successful soul winner, manifesting a pure spirit and
a godly life; but he afterwards became discouraged and
went into business to support his family. In a letter from
him in later years I received the following words:</p>

<blockquote><p>"At the time I got your postal I was in serious meditation on spiritual
affairs and was fully considering re-entering the Gospel ministry.
I know I was called of the Lord through His Holy Spirit to
preach His everlasting gospel. Praise His holy name! He gave
me the seal of His approval in the witness of His Spirit and the
fruit of my labor in the salvation of souls. I know this of a truth
from experience. You cannot imagine how I long, Oh, so intensely,
to be again filled with His Spirit and to enter upon His work in
the salvation of souls.</p>

<p class="center">
Lovingly yours,</p>
<p class="signature">I. H. N."
</p></blockquote>


<h4>A COLORED WOMAN SAVED AND PREACHING.</h4>

<p>In the year 1886 I was holding meetings in Houston,
Texas. Was in a colored people's church one day, and was
much perplexed as to how to reach the people's hearts. I
wept before the Lord in prayer. I did not know it then, but
God was working, using my zeal and grief to help save a
soul. Finally a woman who came to scoff and ridicule was
converted. She received a call to preach after vowing that
women were never called to preach. Well, the years rolled
by and one night in Oklahoma City I saw the Salvation
Army gathering in a tent. I went in and was invited to
read the Word and lead the meeting. I did so, and as the
services were about to close a colored woman arose and
said she wished to state that she was saved, and told how
she was also called to preach by the Spirit of the Lord
through what I said in that meeting in Houston, Texas, so
long before. She labored for years as an evangelist and so
far as I know is still preaching. In her evangelistic work
she has labored successfully in many of the states.</p>

<p>At one time she wrote of her conversion as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"When I was seeking life in the Lord, I did not want to eat for
two weeks, and had no appetite, but I prayed on and the change
came and I felt brand new. I loved everybody&mdash;white and colored.
I seemed to have on a white garment, and that death had fallen
beneath my feet and had no more dominion over me. It seemed
that I had seen the Lord and He told me to go in peace and sin no
more, and I was one more happy soul. I wanted to tell everybody
what the Lord had done for my soul."</p></blockquote>


<h4>STRIKING EXPERIENCES.</h4>

<p>Once while holding meetings in Wichita, Kansas, I was
greatly troubled. I knew not why. I could neither preach
nor sing. I did not know what was wrong. Suddenly a
large man rose and rushed from the room taking his wife
and children with him. He told me afterward that he came
with the avowed purpose of killing another man who was
there. And they both came there with the intention of killing
each other.</p>

<p>At the same mission a man came running in and said
that a young railroad man across the street in the jail was
dying, having taken poison. I went to the jail where the
young man was lying on the floor and kneeling beside him,
took his hand and for two hours pleaded with God to spare
his life and save his soul. And the Lord answered prayer.
The doctors were amazed and perplexed, as they could not
understand how the man could live, as all their efforts had
seemed to be fruitless. It was simply one of God's miracles.</p>


<h4>SAVED BY A HYMN.</h4>

<p>Passing along the street one night in Louisville, Ky., I saw
standing in a doorway a group of well-dressed young ladies,
also a lady much older. I spoke to them and asked for a
drink of water and some favor to further the conversation.
When once in doors I saw a piano, and said, "Which one of
you ladies will play a piece on the piano? I love music so
much." A little boy four years old came in. They asked
him to tell me what he intended to be when he grew up.
He said, "A preacher. I am going to see my mamma in
Heaven." He was their sister's boy. He sang for me while
one of his aunts played the piano. In his sweet, lisping
voice he sang, "I never will cease to love Him." I was impressed
to ask him to come to the mission where I was
going to preach that night, and sing that piece, and have
the aunt play the organ. Both consented to go with me and
when I asked him the little boy came on the platform and
sang beautifully. His father had heard of my desire to have
the child sing, and had straggled into the mission under the
influence of strong drink. He was so convicted and heart-broken
he wept, and that four-year-old boy walked from
the platform down the aisle to that lonely, heart-sick father,
who then and there gave himself up to God, and was saved
before he left the hall, through the singing of a hymn!</p>

the time in the daily of Huntington, Ind., where it occurred:</p>


<h4>KILLED BY CARS.</h4>

<blockquote><p>A. C. Hoffman, a switchman in the Chicago &amp; Atlantic yards, was
run over and killed this morning.</p>

<p>He was employed at night and about 5 o'clock this morning went
to the coal dock to run down two cars that had been unloaded there.
The track is very much inclined leading from the dock and it
requires that brakes be set very tight. When the cars started down
the track Hoffman ran from the rear end to the front of the head
car to set the brake, but in doing so stubbed his toe and fell from
the car to the middle of the track beneath. The car was running
rapidly and no sooner did he strike the track than a brake beam of
the car struck his right leg near the hip, fracturing the bones and
bruising it otherwise. That threw him over and the flange of a
wheel struck the lower part of his back, tearing the flesh all off clear
to his backbone, exposing it to sight.</p>

<p>Hoffman was picked up and taken to the Arlington house, where
he boarded, and Dr. L. Severance, the railroad surgeon summoned.
He did all in his power to make the injured man easy and alleviate
his pain, but it was out of the reach of medical skill to save his life
and at about 10 o'clock he died in awful agony.</p>

<p>Hoffman's mother and brother live in Lincoln, Neb., where the
latter is a physician. He also has a sister in Elkhart county, this
state, all of whom have been telegraphed the sad news.</p>

<p>He was a good switchman and more than ordinarily intelligent.</p>

<p>It is a most distressing accident. The young man was here among
strangers and died surrounded by the friends of so short an acquaintance
but who did everything within human power to save him or
make his end one of peace. His injuries were fatal though and
nothing short of death would relieve him.</p></blockquote>

<p>"ALL ABOARD!" So shout the railroad men, year in
and year out, daily, hourly, their cry is to get on board the
train. I often think if we preachers and mission workers
were as faithful in <em>our</em> work to get people on board the old
ship Zion, how many to-day would be en route for Heaven
who are on the broad-gauge rapid transit to the bottomless
pit of destruction. Will we not arise and shine for God
as we have never done before?</p>

<p>Over fifty years ago when I was a small child, I stood at
a flag-station waiting for the train. I was to go alone <small>ON
MY FIRST TRIP</small> by this wonderful mode of travel. It was
just the grandest thing to know I was really to ride on a
railroad train&mdash;only four miles, yet I often think of it after
these twenty years of constant travel. Have I ever had such
a remarkable experience, going alone, too, and as there was
no station or ticket office, I was obliged to pay my fare on
the train. I had a silver 25-cent piece, and I sat down in the
first empty seat I came to and waited to see what next!
Along came a tall man in uniform and asked where I was
going. I told him and handed him my money. I remember
yet how kindly that conductor looked at me, hesitated a little
and then handed me back my quarter, and let me ride those
four miles free. I have never forgotten that act of kindness
on the railroad, and during my pilgrimage I have been
shown much kindness by the railroad officials.</p>

<p>My work among railroad men has been greatly owned and
blessed of the Lord. Many of them saying, "You are the
only preacher that ever speaks to us about our soul's salvation."
They often say I remind them of their mothers who
were good Christians.</p>

<p>The following by a railroad man will be of interest and
profit to all, and will doubtless have more weight with his
class than anything I could say here:</p>


<h4>TO RAILROAD MEN.</h4>

<p class="center">BY ONE OF THEM.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Boys: One time in my life these words came to me: "<em>Where
will you spend eternity?</em>" Then and there I turned my back on sin
and "set my face like a flint" toward God and heaven, and cried to
God for Jesus' sake to forgive me; and near the hour of midnight
while kneeling at my bedside I received the witness of the Spirit that
I was saved. Then and there I was "born again" into newness of
life. I was changed from a man of sin to a child of God, and since
then such wonderful joy and peace fills my soul every minute of the
time that I want to tell all of you about it.</p>

<p>Brother, isn't there in your breast at times an awful aching void?
Aren't there times when after trying every pleasure and amusement
the world affords, you just quietly sit down all alone before God, and
realize that it is all in vain? These things don't satisfy; and there down
deep in your heart is a longing that is never satisfied, a hungering for
something that will give you complete joy and peace, and soul rest.
Brother, there is only one thing that will give you this complete rest,
and satisfy every longing of your heart, and that is salvation from
sin. Jesus died on the cross that you might be free from sin and
live through all the ages of eternity with Him in heaven. "If we
forsake our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and
cleanse us from all unrighteousness." If we do the forsaking He
will do the forgiving, and then through His atoning blood we become
new creatures, and after we have received the clear witness that we
are adopted into the family of God and can truly call Him Father,
if we feel angry at times or have some desire for the world and the
things of it, we can come to Him again and completely abandon
ourselves to Him, our will, our life, our desires, our time, our talents
to be used for His glory, then He will baptize us with the Holy
Ghost and power so that it becomes a pleasure to do right and all
evil becomes distasteful to us. By the power of the Holy Ghost He
cleanses our hearts, and the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost takes
up His abode in us, sanctifying us, causing us to live pure, holy
lives. We railroad men whose lives are in danger at all times
should be prepared to meet God, for one minute we are here and
the next we may be standing at the judgment bar of God to answer
for deeds done here on earth. Dear reader, are you prepared to
do that? If not, make this the time that you will settle this forever
by giving your heart to God, then if this little flame of life is snuffed
out you will be borne on angel's wings onward and upward through
the gates of pearl, over the golden paved streets of the New Jerusalem
up to the great white throne where you will see Jesus in all His
glory and majesty and hear Him say to you, "Well done, enter thou
into the joy of the Lord."</p>

<p>Let me tell you, brother, when the Lord saved me and gave me
such sweet joy and peace I told Him that I would never use beer or
tobacco in any form, for I knew it was displeasing to Him, for He
says, "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you?" (1 Cor. 6:19). "If any man defile the
temple of God, him shall God destroy" (1 Cor. 3:17). "Cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit" (2 Cor. 7:1).</p>

<p>And, brother, perhaps you are a slave to tobacco. Many times
you have felt that it was a dirty, useless, expensive habit, and you
get thoroughly disgusted with it, and perhaps you quit it for a short
time, and then how surprised and disgusted you feel because you
find what an awful hold it has got on you. It is worse than a spell
of sickness to try and quit it, and you soon take it up again, realizing
as you do so that you are harboring something that is stronger
than you are, appetite; and although you are a strong, robust man
you have to admit that it is your master. And when you go home to
meet your mother, wife, sister, you notice them shrink away from the
breath made foul by the poisonous tobacco. And the times that it
almost destroys the taste for anything else, and you use all the more
of it till the disagreeable "heartburn" warns you that the deadly
poisonous nicotine is eating away at the lining of your stomach, and
you are more disgusted than ever, but you can't quit without torturing
yourself.</p>

<p>Oh, how I loved my beer, plug of tobacco and pipe before I was
saved, but I quit them all&mdash;drinking, chewing, smoking, swearing and
all immoral habits, and I would have died before I would have indulged
in any one of them in the least; but the <em>desire</em> was still there;
at times I wanted them. And seven days after I was saved
I was convicted for sanctification or a clean heart. There were some
Holy Ghost Christian people who told me there was a place I could get
in the higher or complete Christian life where God through Jesus'
blood shed without the gate (Heb. 13:12) would cleanse my heart
from everything that was displeasing to Him, and would so fill it
with love and the power of the Holy Ghost that I would be <em>completely
delivered from all desires that were wrong</em>, from anger, malice,
pride, love of the world, lust, jealousy, etc., and take away the appetite
for beer and tobacco. I found God's Word taught it, and believed
He was "strong to deliver," and that it was God's will, even
my sanctification (1 Thes. 4:3).</p>

<p>And I cried to God to give me "a clean heart, and a right spirit,"
and he answered my prayer. It was done instantly. I arose from
my knees with a sweet sense of complete deliverance, and such joy
and perfect peace filled my whole being that I couldn't praise Jesus
enough for it. From that moment I have not had the least desire
for those things any more than if I never had tasted them, and the
very smell of beer or tobacco makes me sick. This is a wonderful,
grand deliverance. Now I am as free as the very air&mdash;saved, sanctified,
and sweetly kept by the power of God.</p>

<p>Brother, this is for you if you are willing to give up the foolishness
of the world for Christ. The joy that we have in one hour in the
service of the Lord is far greater than all the pleasure the world
can give in a lifetime. This power of the Holy Ghost within us, this
abiding Comforter fills us with glad sunshine all the time, and there
is constantly a power like "a wall of fire round about us" warding
off all evil.</p>

<p>Oh, it's glorious and grows better and brighter each day.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!</span>
<span class="i0">Heir of salvation, purchased of God,</span>
<span class="i0">Born of His spirit, washed in His blood."</span>

<h4>TRANSPORTATION.</h4>

<p>People sometimes ask me how I am able to get transportation
on the railroads. Well, in a few words, it is because
I pray to the Lord to have the way open to whatever place
He wants me to go, and the railroad men know me and of
my work for suffering humanity, and are glad to help me
in it.</p>


<h4>A KIND CONDUCTOR.</h4>

<p>On July 17, 1903, I was on my way from Washington,
D. C., on an important journey, and the conductor told me
the train I was on did not stop at Sherwood, and I wanted
to know where I should stop to get another train that would
stop there. He told me at Defiance, and when we reached
there I got off the train. Just then the conductor looked
out and called for a porter to "put that lady back on the
train." I was bewildered at this. He again called "put
that lady back on the train." I said, "Isn't this Defiance?"
"Yes, but I shall put you off at Sherwood." Who told that
conductor to telegraph to headquarters to get a permit to
stop the train for me? God did it! That conductor will
never know how much his act strengthened my faith in God.
Dear reader, do you ever think of the hardships and dangers
through which these railroad men must pass? We put
ourselves in their care without praying for them. I seldom
enter a train without praying God to protect the railroad
men and passengers, and give them His blessing. He does
hear and answer prayer. How often the dear Lord has
heard my cries for the safety of the trains!</p>

<p>Some of my</p>


<h4>MOST INTERESTING GOSPEL SERVICES</h4>

<p>have been held on railway trains. As I was once leaving
Chicago over the C. &amp; R. I. R. R. at night, a request was
made that I should sing for the passengers. I was conversing
with Mrs. Colonel Clark of the Pacific Garden Mission,
Chicago. As she was to soon leave the train I said I would
sing when she had gone. I sang some hymns, and then a
gentleman requested that I should ask all in the car who
were Christians to raise their hands. I did so and quite a
number responded to this, and he then asked all who had
raised their hands to give a word of testimony. He was
the first one to speak and said, "I am a Christian. The last
thing before I left my home for Chicago was to gather my
wife and four little children around me and commit them
to God's care and ask for my safe return. I have for years
been a stock dealer and frequently come to Chicago. There
is a young man in our neighborhood who is also a dealer
in stock, but being unacquainted with the ways of the city,
he did not like to go alone and as I was a Christian came
with me. When there is an opportunity like this given, if I
did not honor God and show my colors this young man
could have no confidence in me. I speak for his special
benefit." He closed with an exhortation to the unsaved to
prepare to meet God and requested me to sing again. Then
one after another arose and spoke. It reminded one of <small>AN
OLD-FASHIONED METHODIST CLASS MEETING</small>. Prayer, testimonies
and singing continued till after midnight. The
young stock dealer and others were saved. Toward morning
I fell into a sound sleep. I do not know how long I
slept, but when I awoke the sun was high and our car was
standing alone on the track. A lady passenger spoke to me
saying, "How could you sleep during that wreck?" "What!
has anything happened?" I said. "Yes, a wreck," she replied.
The engine and other cars were gone and they were
clearing up the wreck. I heard from that meeting years
afterwards.</p>

<p>One night a meeting was held in the open air for the
special benefit of railroad men. I asked all who wanted to
be saved to raise their hands; then said, "Will you not give
your hearts to God now?" One year from that time while
in meeting a man arose and said that he was in the crowd
that night, and raised his hand, and then at once looked to
God and was saved then and there.</p>


<h4>TRAIN SAVED FROM WRECK IN ANSWER TO PRAYER.</h4>

<p>The Lord has often made known to me when the train
was in danger. I could see the plots laid by wicked men to
wreck the train, and when I have prayed, He, in answer to
prayer, has delivered us from harm and death. He says:
"The very hairs of your head are all numbered," and "I
will never leave thee nor forsake thee."</p>

<p>At one time I had been in old Mexico and changing cars
at El Paso, Texas, I found a heavy trainload of passengers
on the way east. I was impressed all night of impending
peril. I could not sleep, and walked the floor of the car in
silent prayer. I went to the young sister with me and
said, "The train is in great danger, and something will happen
unless the Lord delivers us. The text comes to me so
forcibly, 'What, could ye not watch with me one hour?'
Watch and pray!" That night six train-robbers had determined
to wreck and rob the train. They had stolen six
horses and gone to a lonely place uninhabited for miles
about. They bound and gagged the section foreman and his
men, then took the switch-key and threw the switch to wreck
the train. When they saw the train passing on they tried to
hail it with their lanterns, but by some mysterious power of
God their lights were put out, so that the engineer did not
see them. Then they tried to board the train but were unable
to succeed. It was a most remarkable occurrence. They
either did not open the switch properly and the train set it
back to its place, or the hand of God closed the switch. The
newspapers published quite an account of this incident,
from which source the above concerning the robbers was
obtained, as they were caught and made confession.</p>


<h4>A TRAIN IN DANGER.</h4>

<p>In July, 1889, I was on my way from St. Joseph, Missouri,
to St. Louis, having with me a man and his wife. About 1
o'clock in the morning I awoke with awful fear upon me
of some impending danger. I told my friends that we must
pray for God to save the train, and that no power but God's
could avert the coming disaster, whatever it might be. Still
the horror as of death was upon me, and later in the night
the train suddenly stopped. The train men ran out with
their lanterns and found that the engine had become uncoupled
from the cars and just in front of the engine was a
pile of iron. The iron rails of the track were set so that a
wreck would have been the result if God had not interposed.
God thwarted the well-laid plans that had been made to
wreck and rob the train. This was in a lonely place where
no help was near, and the robbers would have the best of
chances to rob the train. On our return west a similar terror
came upon me and I said, "Pray for this train, or something
will happen to it before we reach St. Joe." I was
terrified all day. Just as the train stopped at the depot our
car was wrecked. The front wheels of the car were turned
around crosswise of the track, tearing up the planks, rails
and earth. Such a queer looking wreck, and apparently no
reason for it! Yet we had been brought in safety to our
journey's end and no one was injured.</p>


<h4>IMPRESSED TO LEAVE THE TRAIN.</h4>

<p>At another time after preaching at Canon City prison in
Colorado, we had our baggage checked to Leadville in the
same state. We held meetings on the train and some were
moved to tears. When the engine whistled for Salida a
dreadful feeling of fear and terror overtook me. Something
seemed to say to me, "<em>Get off the train</em>." I felt it was a
command from the Lord. I told the friends who were with
me what the words of the Lord were, and said that we must
leave the train. We hurriedly left the train without waiting
for another warning. I looked after the train as it moved
away and said, "I wonder why I had to leave that train.
Perhaps not till the judgment will I know." We went on the
street and held an open air meeting, and some one invited
us to hold a service that night in a church. We did so, and
God poured out his Spirit on the people. After the meeting
we went out and visited the saloons, and spoke to many
about their souls. At about 11 o'clock at night we returned
to the depot and I asked the agent what time the next train
would leave for Leadville. He said, "I don't know. The
train you got off from was terribly wrecked twelve miles up
the road. The east-bound train crashed into it, and I have
sent out two wrecking trains already." I told him of my
presentiment of danger, and how God had impressed me
to leave that train. He asked me to come into the office and
explain my impressions and talk to him. We did so, and
about 3 o'clock in the morning the wrecked train backed
down to the depot where we were waiting and we again got
aboard. I told the passengers as they looked at me as I
came into the car, "The Lord warned me of the danger and
impressed me to get off the train." I have taken the Lord
as my guide all these years and He has never forsaken me.</p>


<h4>A TELEGRAM RECEIVED.</h4>

<p>Waiting for a train where I changed cars I was invited
to sit in the ticket office, as the waiting room was uncomfortable.
I was writing at the agent's desk when he handed
me a telegram, saying, "I think this is intended for you,
Mother." It was an announcement of the death of one of my
brothers, and was being sent to another town, having to be
transferred here, and the agent seeing my name handed it to
me. I could see the hand of God in this.</p>


<h4>HELPED TO CARE FOR WOUNDED MAN.</h4>

<p>Once on my way from Burlington to Ft. Madison, Ia.,
I told the conductor I was impressed to go on that special
train. When we were about a mile out of the city, the engine
accidentally struck a man and hurt him badly. The man
was put into the baggage car and as there were no seats, I
stood behind him and held his head, and after we had gone
twelve miles, warm water was secured and I washed the
blood from his head and cared for him until we arrived at
the station, when they took him to the jail, there being no
other place for him, and there I helped the doctor dress
his wounds. Then I knew why I was impressed to go on
that train.</p>


<h4>CONDUCTOR'S GOD BLESS YOU.</h4>

<p>Once the conductor on a train said to me so kindly, as he
assisted me from the train, "God bless you; let your good
work go on. I gave the tracts you gave me to the trainmen&mdash;they
needed them." How this cheered me, for I
had tried to preach to them on the train, and I feared the
scoffs or reproof of the railroad officials. How I do long
to help and encourage the railroad men&mdash;they are so loyal
and faithful, and have so much to contend with in their
work. "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
good."</p>


<h4>A WOMAN'S FAITH ENCOURAGED.</h4>

<p>On the way from Philadelphia to New York I was one
day led to pass quietly through the car giving out tracts.
After seating myself, a lady came and asked if she might
speak with me about the work I was doing. She said, "If
I only knew God could and would heal a person whose mind
was shattered, I would give all that I possess. I am troubled
about my daughter's grieving over the death of her husband."
I told her God never fails to perform his miracles
when we fully believe and accept God's way of healing the
body and soul. She seemed much blessed and encouraged
and kindly invited me to her home. "As ye go, preach."
How glad she was to find some one who would tell her
about salvation. She was a wealthy lady, as I afterward
learned. We became fast friends and she learned of healing
in answer to "the prayer of faith."</p>


<h4>RIDING IN PARLOR CAR.</h4>

<p>Leaving the Indian School in Indian Territory on one
of the coldest mornings I ever experienced, myself and sisters
were driven by two young Indian boys to a flag station.
We were wrapped in warm blankets and hurried to the
railroad. We were in danger of freezing, as the train was
long delayed on account of the blizzard and snow drifts, and
we sought the only place of shelter&mdash;a freight car in which
the section foreman and his wife lived, where we shivered
with the cold until the train came in sight.</p>

<p>We were compelled to stop in the parlor car (a luxury
that I never indulge in) as platforms of the other cars were
too icy to pass from one car to another while the train was
in motion. We were much blessed, and I began singing,
and praising the Lord. When the train came to a station,
we arose to go into the other car, but a gentleman passenger
called to the conductor and said: "How much is the fare
for these ladies to remain in this car?" He and his companion
paid the amount required and we were permitted to
ride in the parlor car to Topeka, Kansas.</p>

<p>My soul was so blessed that I felt I must go into the other
cars and hold services. We were invited to go to the diner
with friends. When we arrived at the station where dinner
was served, one after another of the passengers handed me
some money. When we came in from dinner I knelt down
in the car, and was praying in silence, thanking God for
what He had given us, when I felt someone crush some
paper in my hands. I looked to see what it was and found
it was a ten dollar bill, given by the two gentlemen who had
paid our fare in the parlor car. Of course I was greatly surprised,
and as Sister Taylor was kneeling by my side, I
said, "Sister, this must be in answer to your prayer. Did
you pray for money?" She said "Yes, I prayed for hours
last night." I said, "Why you should have been praying
for souls." She answered, "I knew you needed money, and
no one was giving it to you." Thus God hears and answers
prayers and provides for the needs of his little ones.</p>

<p>I give below a letter received from one of the gentlemen
who gave us the ten dollars who was a prominent business
man in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Pittsburg, Pa., March 25, 1899.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. R. Wheaton, Tabor, Iowa.
</p>

<p>My Dear Madam: Your card of the 18th duly received and I was
glad to hear from you and to have your good wishes, but was
especially grateful for your prayers, for I believe in prayer. Do
you realize how much a busy man needs the prayers of God's people?</p>

<p>Brother M., my companion whom you met last fall in Indian Territory,
is well and I know will be glad to hear from you. I will see
him next week, D. V.</p>

<p>If you pass through our city on your trip East, and I know of it,
would gladly call upon you.</p>

<p>With best wishes for your welfare, and Mrs. Taylor's, too, I am,</p>

<p class="center">
Very truly your friend,</p>
<p class="signature">T. M. N.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following brief extract is from a report of a service
on the train as we were in company with a number of delegates
on their way to the Convocation of Prayer at Baltimore,
in January, 1903:</p>

<blockquote><p>We left Indianapolis at 3:05 p. m., Monday. After we started
Mother Wheaton, who was with us, started up a song, then went to
the front of the car, and standing in the aisle she began preaching
to the people. She moved down the aisle still preaching, taking about
ten minutes to come through the car. This she did several times,
then went through the dining and palace cars. As she told of her
prison work, how God could save criminals, we could see tears come
into the eyes of the passengers. A U. S. marshal sitting near us
became much affected, and made inquiry of Brother S. B. Shaw
who the woman was, and said he knew what she said was true, and
said he desired to be saved. A wealthy Mexican on the train, whose
wife had recently died while he was on a trip to Europe, was also
brought under conviction, and would have Sister Wheaton take dinner
in the dining car; also had Sisters Wheaton and Shaw take a
berth in the sleeper at his expense. I must not forget to tell you
that Brother Shaw gave us an excellent talk standing in the aisle of
the car.</p></blockquote>


<h4>FAVOR THE R. R. CO.</h4>

<p>I sometimes have an opportunity to do a kindness for the
R. R. Co., in return for the many favors they do for me.
At one time I reached the railroad station at Fort Worth,
Texas, before my train arrived. While we were waiting for
a Santa Fe train, an old lady who was evidently not in her
right mind and who had been sent by friends to go alone to
other friends who lived at a distance, of her own accord
tried to climb over one train to get to another and was
injured. The injury was caused by her own mental condition
and through no fault of the railroad men.</p>

<p>Before she left us, I wrote a little message of love and put
it into her hand bag with my name and address on it. In a
few days I received the following letter from her attorneys.</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Fort Worth, Tex., November 21, 1898.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. R. Wheaton, Tabor, Iowa.
</p>

<p>Dear Madam: We conclude from a kind and sympathetic letter
you wrote to Mrs. Harper, the old lady who fell from the platform at
the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway depot at Fort Worth, Tex.,
on Friday night, the 11th day of November, that you likely saw the
old lady fall. And perhaps you can tell us how she came to fall and
who else saw her when she fell. Mrs. Harper has employed us to sue
the railroad company for said injuries. She claims that she walked
off of the platform where there were no railings and fell between
two freight cars left standing on the track, left so far apart that
she could see the railroad car she wanted to board between said opening

<p>In reply I assured them that it would be utterly unjust to

facts as far and as fully as I knew them. I learned later
that this ended the contemplated suit.</p>

<p>Many are the shocking sights and sad experiences I have
witnessed in street and slum work. I have endured hardships
and privations, suffered arrests and ridicule, and faced
many dangers. But withal, the glorious victories have been
many and precious souls have been saved:</p>

<p>I might give copies of many permits to hold open air
services received in the earlier years of my labors, but perhaps
these would not be of interest or profit, so I give
only a few.</p>

<h4>FROM MISS JOSEPHINE COWGILL.</h4>

<p class="center">Some Years a Missionary in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The following is contributed by a dear sister who has
spent some years as a missionary in Jerusalem, Palestine,
and may be known to many of our readers:</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Josephine" id="Josephine"></a>
<img src="images/ill-p330.jpg" width="300" height="404" alt="MISS JOSEPHINE COWGILL." title="MISS JOSEPHINE COWGILL." />
<span class="caption">MISS JOSEPHINE COWGILL.</span>
</div>

<blockquote><p>Many years ago, while engaged in missionary work in the city
of New Orleans, La., I was one evening attracted by a large gathering
of people. In the midst was a woman kneeling on the ground
engaged in most earnest prayer. Many in the company were of
the worst class of people, yet they were quietly listening and
looking on with amazement. We were not accustomed to any one
praying on the streets in that manner. This was the first time
I had the privilege of meeting dear Sister E. R. Wheaton. I can
never forget the impressions made upon myself and others by her
prayers, exhortations and songs that evening. Standing near me
in that company was a woman who had charge of one of the
worst houses of prostitution in the city. Trembling and weeping
she said to me "I never heard anything like that before. That
woman makes me feel that I am an awful sinner, and yet she
loves me." That poor woman went to her house, sent for a Bible
and read it and spent the night in bitter repenting for her sins.
She was gloriously converted and then called her household together
and told them her experience and how the Lord had pardoned
her sins and made her happy in His love. She then exhorted
them to commence a new life; but if they would not, then
they must leave her house.</p>

<p>While in New Orleans, Sister Wheaton and those in company
with her were busily and successfully engaged in mission work
among prisoners and others of the worst class. Some years afterward
she again visited that city and the Lord greatly blessed
her work. One night, on a store-box in front of a saloon, she
preached to a large crowd. The saloonkeeper became very uneasy
and called a policeman to "take her away." He came, but found
it quite hard work to get her down and to another place. The
people wanted to hear her. She sang a song, the chorus of which
was, in part:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"If to Jesus you are true,</span>
<span class="i0">There's a glory waits for you,</span>
<span class="i1">In the beautiful, the glad forever."</span>
</div>

<p>Then with clasped hands she stood quietly gazing upward, with
tears rolling down her cheeks. Then with much feeling she said:
"I am homesick for heaven." I can never forget how those
words impressed me and others at that time.</p>

<p>Some years after I again met Sister Wheaton in Los Angeles,
California, where her work was like it had been in New Orleans.
At one time, when she had kindly offered me the privilege of
going with her to some other points, I made inquiry about how I
should take my trunk. She replied: "Sister Josephine, pilgrims
for God do not need a trunk. One valise is enough." Many times
I have thought of that reply and the good it did me. I have
never known of a more earnest and self-sacrificing Christian worker
than Sister Wheaton. The results of her labors as she has gone
forth "weeping and bearing precious seeds," cannot be fully
known until with rejoicing she comes "bringing sheaves with
her." In loving remembrance of her, I am,</p>

<h4>MY FIRST STREET MEETING.</h4>

<p>My first street meeting was in Washington, D. C., near
the old postoffice. I had spent the day in the jail, alms-house
and hospitals. I was then a stranger in the city.
Some one asked me to go to a hall where there was a little
mission. We did so, and found they had gone to the open
air meeting. When we arrived the meeting was in progress,
one after another stepping out to testify or sing. No
opportunity was offered me to take any part in the meeting,
as no woman was allowed to testify. I looked to God
in silent prayer to open some way for me to speak to the
people. At the close of their service I spoke, saying, "The
Lord has sent me with a message for you dear people, and
now the friends have closed their meeting and we will not
detain them, as they doubtless have other engagements."
I began to sing and God filled my soul with glory. The
needs of those poor hungry souls rose before me, as I sang
and prayed, and the message of love came welling up in my
soul. I spoke to them of righteousness, the coming Judgment
and eternity. I had held meetings in many of the
principal cities of America, some in Europe and other
countries. But that night God anointed me for street
preaching and for work in slums, dives and saloons.</p>

<p>Closing the meeting, I thought of being alone on the
street at night with scarcely any money and not knowing
my way back to my lodging place. I said, "Oh, Lord, you
know all about it." Walking along I came to the mission
and stepping in I took a seat near the door. While I sat
praying, a brother rose and told the circumstances of the
street meeting I had held, and that one of the worst men in
the city had been converted through its instrumentality.
The man had told the brother that God had saved him and
he was going home to write eight letters to his people, some
of them in this and some in the old country, to tell them
what great things God had done for him. God knew I
was there and sent the message to encourage me. After
the service in the hall had closed a young lady who proved
to be the daughter of the landlady where I had been staying,
came to me and walked to her home with me. I could not
have found my way alone, not having their number, but
God cared for me.</p>

<p>Some extracts are given from reports of the work which
were published at different points during the first few years
of my labors:</p>


<h4>CONVERTED TO CHRIST.</h4>

<p class="center">THE CASE OF THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN&mdash;CARD FROM MR. M.</p>

<blockquote><p>Editor Hawk-Eye: Last evening at about seven o'clock Mrs.
Wheaton, the prison evangelist, and another lady of the evangelists
and myself held a meeting on the levee. Mrs. Wheaton, who
spoke on the future consequence of sin with unusual earnestness,
had the effect of breaking down Mrs. A. into tears. Mrs. Wheaton
went up to her and spoke to her. In a few moments the unfortunate
woman broke into ecstasies of joy and commenced to leap
around in a circle. For ten minutes she kept up praising God and
leaping, when suddenly she leaped through the great crowd around,
some now being horrified, who, like many poor, unfortunate people,
never saw a sudden conversion. She ran up Jefferson street,
where she was arrested and locked up.</p>

<p>Had the woman been rich or popular she would have been kindly
treated, but being one of the unfortunate women of our city she
was locked up in an unclean, old filthy cell, with a bunk for a bed.
The police were informed that the woman was converted and a
lady offered to take her home last night. But they kept her in
that terrible cell with inmates in adjoining cells using obscene language.
It is a sin and disgrace for the city fathers to continue to
have women locked up with men in the same line of cells with
such a horrifying stench and wooden bunks. The city police are
guilty of an outrageous act in confining the woman in such a
cell, when they ought to have given her better quarters, as they
had the opportunity. This morning she was brought out before
the police court; the woman still testified that she had salvation
before that court and crowd of people. But good came out of it
all as she witnessed a grand confession to the police court and
people who never heard the gospel. She was, by the consent of
Captain S., taken to Mrs. H.'s and is doing well and is converted.
Last evening's <cite>Gazette</cite> stated that the woman went crazy by attending
the street meetings and would be examined before the
board of commissioners of insanity, which is every word of it untrue.
The woman is sane and was not before any board.</p>

<h4>A WONDERFUL CONVERSION.</h4>

<p>In San Francisco a drunken girl came to my meeting on
the street so desperate and dangerous that even the police
at times seemed afraid of her. She seemed to be a veritable
Magdalene. I was impressed with the words, "Down in
the human heart, crushed by the tempter, feelings lie buried
that grace can restore." How could it be done? I dealt
faithfully with her and went away, returning to the city
ten months later. She came again to my meetings, once
very drunk as she usually was. I talked to her about her
need of salvation and she was finally convicted. She waited
at the close of the meeting to speak with me, but at first
would not yield to God. Finally she sobered up and was
wonderfully converted. I took her to my room and cared
for her, and as she was a desperate character, and liable to
do injury both to life and property, the Rescue Home at
San Francisco refused to take her, so I took all the risks
myself and took her to Helena, Montana, and left her at
the Rescue Home at that place.</p>

<p>The following is an account of work in Seattle soon after
this as reported by a paper of that city:</p>


<h4>THE PRISON EVANGELIST.</h4>

<p class="center">MRS. ELIZABETH R. WHEATON CARRYING FORWARD HER MISSION IN
SEATTLE.</p>

<blockquote><p>About three o'clock yesterday afternoon two women, one quite
elderly and the other about 25 years of age, whose dress and demeanor
bespoke them to be missionaries, walked into the sheriff's
office and asked Jailer Leckie if they might hold a short religious
service in the county jail. The urbane jailor replied that he
thought "a little prayin' wouldn't do them coves any harm," but
they were eating and couldn't be interrupted for ten or fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>"Then we'll wait," said Mrs. Wheaton, laying her black shawl
aside and taking a seat, in which she was followed by her sister
evangelist.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to know who we are," said the elder
of the two women to a reporter who happened to be present. "Here
is my card," and she handed over a small piece of pasteboard on
which was printed with a rubber stamp, "Elizabeth R. Wheaton,
Prison Evangelist. Jesus is Coming Soon; Prepare to Meet Thy
God."</p>

<p>"That will tell who I am," continued the evangelist....
"Criminals and fallen women are the ones I try to reach. I would
rather try to save a murderer or fallen woman than your smooth,
respectable hypocrites, every time. Mary and I have just come
through from san Francisco." * * *</p>

<p>At this moment Jailer Leckie announced that the prisoners were
through eating, and the two women went below to pray with them.
The younger woman held back, saying that she was afraid some
of her old associates might be there, but she was urged on by her
protector and a few minutes later the words of "Nearer My God
to Thee," from two female voices, came floating through the
prison bars. The prisoners gave them respectful hearing, and one
or two seemed to be affected by the earnest words of counsel that
fell from the lips of the evangelist. Later in the evening they held
street services for the benefit of the workingmen near the Armory
and relief tents.</p></blockquote>


<h4>BECAME A PREACHER.</h4>

<p>One of the worst women I ever knew was converted in
the spring of 1885 on the streets of Kansas City, Mo., where
I was holding meetings. She came to the meeting to abuse
and ridicule me. She heard my voice, she said, two blocks
away, and became convicted. She came to where I was
standing on a box preaching. I asked if there was any one
there who would seek God and live a Christian life. I said
if there was one such, let them come and kneel with me by
the box and I would pray for them. She knelt there and
cried mightily to God for mercy. But she went away unsaved
and prayed and wept day and night. She could
neither eat nor sleep. She saw herself a lost sinner. Her
father had been a minister of the Gospel, but had died when
she was very young. She had drifted to this wicked city
in search of work, and you may know the rest. For it is
but the story of many a poor orphan girl in her struggle for
bread. She fell as thousands fall with none to pity or care.
She was driven from one sin to another, until at last disgraced
and filled with shame, she had tried twelve times to
take her own life. Thus I found her a miserable woman.
She came again to the meeting, this time alone, and was
gloriously saved, and is still saved so far as I know. She
became a successful preacher of righteousness, for she
knew how to reach such as she had been. She became a
terror to evil doers, brave in danger, and hopeful before discouraging
obstacles. She has since told me she has saved
many young girls' lives and characters by taking them in
and giving them food and shelter when every other door
except brothels and saloons was closed against them. Bless
God for the homes open to shelter and protect the unfortunate
girls.</p>


<h4>THE BLIND ENCOURAGED.</h4>

<p>One day while traveling in Montana, I went into a smoking
car to hold a little Gospel meeting, singing and distributing
tracts, when I found a blind lady there who seemed to
be alone and neglected. I spoke to her kindly about her
soul and invited her to go with me into the other car. I
said, "I am always glad to do anything I can to help a blind
person. My grandmother was blind several years before her
death." She accepted it all gratefully and seemed very sorry
to part from me when we changed cars. I exhorted her to
a life of Christian service and to meet me in Heaven.</p>

<p>I never expected to meet her again, but some two years
later I was holding an open air meeting in California and
a lady said, "Would you allow me to testify?" and I said,
"Certainly, if you are a Christian. Would be glad to have
you." When she began to speak she said: "This lady don't
know me, but I know her. We met once. Although I have
never seen her, as I am deprived of sight, yet I know her.
I met with her on the train one day," and she related the
foregoing facts, stating that my kindness had won her heart
and she had never forgotten my advice, and was now living
a Christian life.</p>


<h4>FORBIDDEN TO PREACH ON THE STREET.</h4>

<p>One night when I attempted to hold a street meeting in
F&mdash;&mdash;, California&mdash;where I had been holding services for a
few nights&mdash;the marshal said he had forbidden me to preach
and sing on the streets. A gentleman looked up the law
books and returned saying that it was not contrary to the
laws of that city at that time to hold a gospel meeting on
the street and that I could proceed, but the marshal came
and forbade me, very unkindly and impolitely. At this
crisis a gentleman came up and said that a saloon keeper
down the street requested me to come and hold a meeting
in front of his place. I said: "A gentleman has requested
that we come and hold a meeting in front of his business
place. We will go there, please," but the marshal in a very
ungentlemanly way said I was not to hold a meeting on the
street any place in that city.</p>

<p>I said we would go to a hall which had been opened for
gospel services. It was several blocks away and only a
few of the immense crowd would walk that distance. When
I reached the place I sat down behind the door and cried
and thought, what shall I do? I was sure the Lord wanted
me to hold a meeting on the street. The blind lady mentioned
in the previous incident was in the congregation and
began to sing, "He is able to deliver thee," and I soon had
the victory. The same sister had attempted to sing on the
street, as this was her only means of supporting her old
mother and sickly husband, and the marshal came along
and without any warning pushed her off the street. A
couple of strange gentlemen came and kindly led her to a
place of safety. I heard soon after this that this man became
suddenly insane and it took two men to hold him and
take him to the jail and from there to the insane asylum.</p>


<h4>THOUGHT THEY SAW A GHOST.</h4>

<p>Once, in a city, another lady and myself were walking
along a very lonesome street late at night. When passing a
large dark building she remarked that it was a very dangerous
gambling den. My heart burned within me. I was
seized with an impulse to go in that place of iniquity and
warn those men of their souls' danger. No sooner thought
than done! I was soon in the room which proved to be vacant,
but I could see light through the cracks of a closed
door leading into the next room. I passed quietly across
the room and opened the door and stood confronting a number
of rough looking men who were seated at a long gambling
table. Without a word I crossed the room with noiseless
footsteps and dropping my Bible on the table and falling
on my knees before them began to cry to God in their
behalf. The men seemed to take an unexpected view of the
situation, and rising simultaneously to their feet, they
rushed wildly from the room upsetting their chairs in their
haste, and I was left alone. The next day the report went
out that a ghost had been seen there the night before, and
some of the men vowed they would never touch a pack of
cards again as long as they lived&mdash;that money could not
hire them to do it. Truly "The wicked flee when no man
pursueth."</p>


<h4>HURT BY A SALOONKEEPER.</h4>

<p>While I was at Springfield, Ill., I was led one Sabbath to
go to the park to hold a gospel meeting, taking two sisters
with me. We had a good meeting, and returning to the
city I asked the street car conductor if there was another
park where I could hold services. He directed me to a
place in another suburb. We went there, and in a grove I
saw some tables and men and women sitting at them,
drinking. I began to sing a hymn, thinking we were in a
public park, when a man rushed out of a house toward me,
saying, "You shan't sing here." I said, "Please let me finish
this verse." He replied, "No, I won't allow any one to
sing here." I knelt in prayer. He did not say I should not
pray. The sisters were looking at him, and said he hurried
toward me in great anger. The sisters prayed to God to
spare me. The man jerked me and pushed me over, when
some of the men at the tables called out to him, "Let go of
that woman. You don't know who she is. We know her."
The men in the meantime running to us, laid hold on the
saloonkeeper and took him away. I was very much hurt.
I could not walk alone. The park proved to be a beer
garden. We went to the nearest house and asked permission
to rest till I should gain strength to return to the city.
The people where we stopped were very indignant, and
said the man had no license to sell liquor on Sunday, and
was violating the city ordinance. There were no arrests.
The whisky men must have their own way in this land of
American liberty. They can ruin lives, break up homes,
blight the prospects of the best people on earth and fill the
prisons, almshouses, criminal insane asylums, brothels,
graves of paupers, and doom souls by the multitude, and
who cares? Who votes to put down the saloons? Who tries
to save mothers' girls as well as mothers' boys, husbands
and wives? Even the parents are overtaken by the demon
of strong drink and sink into the most depraved conditions
in order to satisfy their craving for alcohol. O, the awfulness
of it all! Sisters, brothers, are you and I clear? Are
we doing our best to stop this horrible traffic in whisky and
girls, for one of these places can scarcely exist without the
other. How many girls and boys are sacrificed yearly to
fill the saloonkeepers' coffers and fill up hell? Think of
these things.</p>


<h4>WARNED TO LEAVE THE CITY.</h4>

<p>Upon entering a town in Mississippi I inquired of a
woman if she could direct me to a hotel, and she told me her
sister and her husband kept one and I would be made comfortable
with them.</p>

<p>We went to the hotel and left our luggage and went at
once to hold an open air meeting. The singing attracted a
considerable crowd, and at the close of the service many
came to shake hands with me and thank me for the meeting,
among whom were a number of colored people, who thanked
the Lord in their characteristic way and asked me to preach
again which I agreed to do that night.</p>

<p>As we turned our steps toward our hotel, we noticed a
colored man walking a short distance ahead of us who,
when we were out of hearing of the crowd, turned and said
to us: "You women don't intend to hold another meeting on
the street to-night?" and I said, "Certainly, I shall obey
God." He said, "You have shaken hands with the colored
people and the white people are angry, and they will mob
you. I came along here for the purpose of warning you.
If they saw me talking with you my life would be in danger."
I told him I was not afraid, thanked him and told
him I would do as the Lord led.</p>

<p>On reaching our hotel the landlord asked if I intended to
hold another meeting on the street that night, and I told him
I did. He said that the townspeople had forbidden me to
hold another service and that I would have to leave his hotel
at once, because I had shaken hands with the colored
people. We told him we had made the appointment and
we should keep our word. He went to his wife and told
her to go and tell those women to leave the house and take
the train, as we had associated with the colored people and
the white people would not allow us to remain in town. She
replied that we had paid our money and our money was as
good as anybody's, and that we were respectable, honest
women and she was going to treat us as such.</p>

<p>When we went down the street we heard a noise as of a
mob, and we went praying the Lord to show us what to do,
and He showed us our life was in danger and to step one
side into the colored people's church where God's presence
was revealed in mighty power and souls were convicted and
converted.</p>

<p>In the morning two colored women called upon me, saying
they had come to warn me and assist me to the train.
One of them said that two nights before she had a terrible
dream about a woman coming to preach on the streets and
was so impressed that she sent her husband four miles to see
if there was anything in it. This was the man that warned
us that night. When he went home and told her what he
had seen and heard, she dreamed again and the Lord told
her to come and help us out of town, as the people would
take my life. They carried our luggage and showed us to
the train and got us safely on board, and with a "God bless
you, Honey, we's prayin' for you," they were gone, and we
went on our way with thankful hearts for our Lord's protecting
care.</p>


<h4>IN JAIL.</h4>

<p>I have several times been arrested for holding services in
the open air, but have been taken to prison but twice&mdash;once
in Glasgow, Scotland, as related elsewhere, and once in
Belleville, Illinois.</p>

<p>In 1889, Sister Anna Kinne wrote me from Belleville that
they were holding meetings at that place, but had seen but
little stir, that it seemed to be a hard field, and that she believed
the Lord wanted me to come and help them in the
meetings. I was, at the time, in Mississippi, but after praying
over the matter I felt that I should go to Belleville in
answer to her request.</p>

<p>The first Sabbath after reaching there I tried to hold services
in the open air, but was stopped by policemen. I tried
again with the same results. Then I went to the mayor, but
was refused permission to hold any such meetings. When
I asked him if he would take the responsibility on the day
of judgment, he said, "Yes." I then went to the jail and
held services, and the sheriff kindly inquired about my work
and showed considerable interest, and took down some
notes. I then asked him for permission to hold meetings
on the court house steps. This was readily granted, and I
took Sister Kinne with me. The marshal of the town had
bitterly opposed my work, and while we were singing he
very rudely and unceremoniously came and took me by the
arm and dragged me down from the steps.</p>

<p>I told him that the sheriff had given me permission to
hold services, but he was very angry and refused to let me
go on.</p>

<p>I said to those who had gathered, "We will have no open
air meeting, but come to Buchanan Hall to-night, and we
will have a meeting there."</p>

<p>I think it was the following night that I was impressed
just before the opening of our services, to sing a hymn,
standing in the mission door. I spoke to Sister Kinne of
this and she said, "God bless you, Sister Wheaton, I will
pray for you."</p>

<p>I went quietly down to the door and was standing there
singing an old-time hymn, when out of the darkness there
came two policemen. Without saying a word they took
hold of me and dragged me along the street. I had no bonnet
on, and my shawl was dragging along in the mud. I
said, "Please let me get my shawl, and will you please let
me ask one of the ladies at the mission to go with me?" But
they refused and seemed glad to think that I was being disgraced.
As I met two or three Christian people, one of
them spoke kindly to me and I replied that I was suffering
for Jesus' sake. "You seem to be well acquainted with the
men," one of the policemen said. "No," I said, "only with a
few Christians."</p>

<p>When we arrived at police headquarters they gave in the
report that I was on the street holding a meeting and was
having a row, etc., which was, of course, utterly false.</p>

<p>I was, of course, surprised at the treatment I was receiving.
I opened my Bible, which I still held, and began reading
in silence. The officer said, "Are you making all of
this ado and trouble?" I replied, "I was standing in our
mission door singing." He said, "Will you give bail for
your good behavior?" I said, "I have no money for bail."
Then he asked me if I had no friends. I told him I was a
stranger in the city. "Then," he said, "I will have to send
you to jail, or what will you do?" I said I did not know.
He then told another policeman to take me to the jail across
the square, and only a few blocks away. This policeman
said to some boys who were standing outside, "You boys
stay here, we do not want a mob." But the marshal said,
"Go along boys. She wants notoriety&mdash;give it to her."
And so I went to the jail with a mob crying after me.</p>

<p>Arriving at the jail the kind jailor was shocked to see me
in the officer's charge, and said, "You are not a prisoner?"
I said, "Yes, I was singing in our mission door, but they
arrested me." His wife came in and kindly said, "Come
into the parlor, and I will make ready for you the spare
bedroom." I was, of course, surprised and deeply touched.
"No, indeed," I said, "I am a prisoner. Take me into the
cell with the other women." Her little daughter came in
and knelt down by my side and kissed my hand, saying how
very sorry she was for me. It was on a Christmas eve, and
the child was going to the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>Soon the sheriff came in in a hurry and said, "You are a
free woman!" He, finding I had been arrested, had notified
friends who had given bail and secured my release. Not
understanding the sheriff, I said, "No, I am here in disgrace,
and I want you to put me in the woman's cell." But
he insisted that I was free. Then I said, "They have put
me here in disgrace, and I want some one to come and take
me to our mission, as it is dark." They then sent for someone
to come for me, and such a shout as went up when I
again entered the mission hall. One good old Christian
friend said, "I told you that if she was a woman of God, and
I knew she was, she would return to the hall before the
meeting was over."</p>

<p>It seems that a reporter who was at the police station at
the time of my arrest and heard the abuse of the officers
had hurried to the sheriff's office, and he, as I have said, had
secured my release.</p>

<p>We give here a verbatim copy of the paper signed by
friends, the original of which I still have in my possession.
Somehow the case was dismissed, and I was never brought
to trial:</p>


<h4>VERBATIM COPY OF A RECOGNIZANCE.</h4>

<p class="center">(12th, 24th, 1899.)</p>

<blockquote><p>
State of Illinois, St. Clair County, ss.
</p>

<p>This day personaly appeared before the undersigned, William
Bornmann, one of the Justices of the Peace in and for said County,
Mrs. E. R. Wheaton, James West and Wm. Meyer, and jointly and
severally acknowledged themselves to owe and be indebted unto the
People of the State of Illinois, in the sum of Twenty-five Dollars,
to be levied on their goods and chattels, lands and tenements, if default
be made in the premises and conditions below, to-wit:</p>

<p>Whereas, The above bounden, Elizabeth R. Wheaton, was, on
the 24th day of December, A. D. 1889, arrested for violation of the
city ordinance, was adjudged and required by said Justice of the
Peace to give bonds, as required by the statute in such cases, made
and provided, for her appearance to answer to said charge. Now
the conditions of this recognizance is such that if the above
bounden, Elizabeth R. Wheaton, shall personally appear and be
before me, in Belleville, on the 27th day of December, A. D. 1889,

to be and remain in full force and virtue.</p>

<p>As witness our hands and seals, this 24th day of December, A. D.
1889.</p>

<p>Taken, entered into, acknowledged and approved before me, this
24th day of December, 1899.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Wm. Bornmann, J. P.</span></p>
<p>Wilhelm Meyer, [L. S.]<br />
Jas. A. West, [L. S.]
</p></blockquote>

<p>This occurrence caused a great deal of excitement at the
time. Some time after I met one of the editors of one of
the principal papers of the town, and he stated that a serious
calamity had overtaken all those who were active in the opposing
and persecuting me, and mentioned some who had
died and others upon whom God's judgments seemed to
have fallen.</p>

<p>The following was taken from a paper published at Belleville:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton, a well known prison evangelist who
has labored in nearly all of the principal prisons of the United
States, was arrested Tuesday evening by Policemen S. and S.,
while she was engaged in conducting a song service, standing in the
door at the entrance to Buchanan Hall, where a series of meetings
are being held by two other evangelists, Mr. and Mrs. S. D. Kinne.
The officers, on arriving on the scene, ordered Mrs. Wheaton to
stop singing, but as she paid no attention to their command, she
was at once arrested and hurried off to the police station, where
she was questioned by the captain of police and the city marshal,
and a little later she was removed to the county jail, but through
the courtesy of the jailor she was not locked up in a cell. A complaint
of disturbing the peace was made against her before Justice
B., and a hearing was fixed for tomorrow before him, and a
bond for her appearance was duly executed; but while these formal
proceedings were being attended to Sheriff R., having heard of Mrs.
Wheaton's incarceration in the county jail, repaired to the institution,
immediately ordered her release, as there was no authority
for holding her there, and when the officer from Justice B.'s court
arrived with the bail bond for Mrs. Wheaton's signature, he was
chagrined to find that the lady had been released by order of the
sheriff. No further attempt was made to arrest her, and it is
probable that the matter will be dropped. Mrs. Wheaton is an
elderly lady and is deeply devoted to Christian work, especially
among the unfortunates confined in jails and prisons, and she has
a large number of testimonials as to her character and work from
prison officials, railway managers and others in all parts of the
country. Many prominent citizens expressed themselves yesterday
as deeply regretting the action of the officers in arresting Mrs.
Wheaton. The same lady, by written permission of Sheriff R.,
attempted to hold religious services from the court house steps
on Sunday evening last, but she was forced to desist by the city
marshal. Mrs. Wheaton applied to Mayor B. recently for permission
to hold open-air religious meetings on the streets, but was
denied the privilege on the ground that considerable disorder had
been occasioned some months ago by the holding of such meetings
by members of the Salvation Army, who held forth in Belleville
for a time. The action of the mayor in refusing to allow the
evangelist to hold open-air meetings, and the arrest of Mrs.
Wheaton while engaged in conducting a song service in the door of
Buchanan Hall, where the revival services are held, is causing a
great deal of severe criticism, owing to the toleration of the parading
of the principal streets by brass bands on Sundays, as well as
other days, to draw audiences for minstrel shows, etc., the gathering
of crowds on the public square by street fakirs, patent medicine
peddlers, quack doctors and others, who deal out rough jokes,
etc., in tones loud enough to be heard blocks away.</p>

<p class="left15">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mary Weems Chapman.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Chicago, Ill.</span></p>
<p>For some years I have been quite intimately associated
with friends who have, perhaps, the largest Rescue Home in
the world. I am told that they have taken in more girls
than any other Home of the kind. Over 1,250 girls have
there been confined and never have they lost one of these
young mothers by death. But, oh, it is a sad sight to see
them, day after day carrying their load of sorrow in their
hearts. Often when I am there, as I manifest toward them
my love and sympathy, they tell me their story of woe sad
as was the cry of Eve when banished from the presence
of God. She yielded to Satan's devices because she believed
the voice of Satan rather than the voice of God.
She became an outcast&mdash;and so our sisters are still being
deceived by the devil in human form and become outcasts
from all that is good. Some of them have been won by a
mess of pottage, a mere bauble or a gewgaw. Others have
the promise of love&mdash;that which every human heart craves.
These believe, trust, yield and are ruined and some of them
are so young! so ignorant! Then there are some who have
been basely betrayed or brutally forced and then left to
bear alone their shame and disgrace&mdash;for, alas! the "traffic
in girls" is not an imaginary thing, but an awful reality.</p>

<p>O that the good people of our fair land would awaken and
see that justice is done in behalf of the helpless and innocent!
Prevention is better than cure. Let us guard the
children and put down every influence that would tend to
demoralize either our boys or girls! But in the meantime,
let us do all within our power to lift up the fallen and win
back those who have gone astray and share the burden and
sorrow of those who suffer through no fault of their own.</p>

<p>Those who have been daring in sin often make the most
gifted, consecrated and valiant workers for God and souls
when truly and fully saved. I bless the Lord for the privilege
of seeking and finding some of these "diamonds in the
rough." I have known many Christian workers who had
once been criminals or fallen, but who had been rescued by
some one who had a knowledge of human nature and a
heart filled with the love of God who told them of the love
of Christ and His wonderful power to save. O when we
all meet in the great Hereafter what a time of rejoicing there
will be among the rescuers and the rescued.</p>


<h4>DRUNKEN WOMEN AND MEN.</h4>

<p>I find hundreds of men and women, many young women,
in drunkenness and crime, and the most open daring sins.
In one of the largest drinking dens in the world I asked
the proprietor if I might sing a hymn, and he gave his consent.
I was obliged to go down stairs and through many
rooms and hallways and then up a dark stairway to the
platform where the orchestra was playing. When they
ceased I sang a hymn which touched their hearts and they
cheered the singing. I offered a prayer and they all seemed
to appreciate it. There were hundreds of <em>men</em> only, drinking,
miners and others. Then I went where there were both
men and women drinking, and sang and prayed with them.
At near midnight, while I was engaged in prayer, one of
the poor, unfortunate girls clasped my hand and put a piece
of silver in it, and stood holding my hand till I rose. She
cried and spoke of her desire to be good. She was reminded
of her old home and her mother. The proprietor
then told me I must leave, as he found he would lose her
from his den. He said he was once a Christian himself,
and on coming west, saw the money to be made in that
kind of business, and fell, and went deep in sin, leading
others down with himself.</p>


<h4>ASSAULTED IN A DIVE.</h4>

<p>While in San Pedro, California, I went, one night, into a
saloon to invite the men to a gospel meeting at the mission
on the same block, and the keeper sprang up from his
gambling table, where he was engaged with several others
in a game of some kind, and rushing towards me, violently
grabbed me by the arms, and then with both hands clutching
me, rushed me to the door, using vile and insulting epithets
to me as he went. At the door a lady said, "This is
a public house; you dare not throw people out who have
done you no harm." He finally released his Satanic grasp
upon me. I had only spoken a few kindly words to two
young men standing at the bar in the act of raising their
glasses to their lips. I had just said, "Don't drink it, boys,
please don't," when the assault was made. As the saloonist
rushed at me, I said, "Don't touch me, please; I will go out."
But he seemed fiendishly happy in injuring and insulting a
helpless old woman, who only wished to do them all good,
and see them saved in Heaven at last. The only excuse he
ever made was that he thought I was Carrie Nation. Commenting
on this occurrence, a Los Angeles paper contained
the following item:</p>

<blockquote><p>San Pedro, March 29.&mdash;"Mother" Wheaton, a well known prison
evangelist, was roughly assaulted by John Wilkins, a Front street
saloonkeeper, shortly after seven o'clock last evening. Mrs.
Wheaton was preaching to a large gathering in front of Wilkins'
joint, and hearing loud cursing within, the aged reformer entered,
intending to invite the blasphemers to Peniel Mission, where services
are held every evening. She had scarcely passed inside the
doors of the dive, when Wilkins rushed forward, seized her and
thrust her backward. At the same time he applied vile epithets
to her, shouting angrily: "Get out of here, woman, and be quick
about it!"</p>

<p>So badly was Mrs. Wheaton injured that she was unable to
return to the mission without assistance. She is confined to her
bed and is suffering severe pains from the shock.</p>

<p>Wilkins explained today that he mistook Mrs. Wheaton for
Carrie Nation, whom the former resembles. No arrests have been
made.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a city where I had been preaching the Gospel, a messenger
came stating that a young girl had cut her throat.
It was an extremely hot day and I had to walk a long distance
across the city. Arriving at the house they told
me that no one was allowed to go in. But I went right in
and everybody stood back. Kneeling down by the poor
girl I took her hand already growing cold in death. Poor
child! Like thousands of others, she had been disappointed
in life. The one who had plighted his troth had broken her
heart, and rather than bear her shame she preferred death.
Then and there I had the privilege of pointing this beautiful
girl to Christ who said, "Neither do I condemn thee.
Go and sin no more," and He who never turns anyone
away heard and answered prayer.</p>

<p>One day I held a meeting in the Crittenden Home for
Fallen Girls, in Washington. They all seemed so glad
to hear me. (There were thirty girls.) They were deeply
moved. After the meeting closed I took each by the hand
and exhorted them to live pure and holy lives. And with
tears in their eyes they promised to try and serve the Lord.
One dear little girl in a short dress (fourteen years old),
clung to me crying, and said Jesus had saved her just then,
in the meeting, and she would be a good girl and live for
Heaven. I clasped her to my heart and thought what Jesus
said about him who offends "one of these little ones."
Some heartless wretch had ruined the girl and left her to
die alone. "Vengeance is <em>mine</em>, <em>I</em> will repay, saith the
Lord."</p>


<h4>A GIRL SAVED.</h4>

<p>Trying to rescue a girl in a low dive in New York city
in 1890, as I entered the den the keeper, a large, strong
man, sprang up and struck me a blow. The girl caught
his arm and cried out, "Don't strike her, she is a lady."
But he thrust me out, and I said to her, "Fly for your life&mdash;out
at the back door." I ran around the saloon and caught
her away from an angry mob and with the help of the sisters
with me, almost carried her six blocks to the Crittenden
Home, and there she was reformed and converted.</p>


<h4>A GIRL REJECTED AT RESCUE HOME.</h4>

<p>In Ft. Worth, Texas, I once found in the jail a poor girl
who was a very desperate character. She had been at the
Rescue Home several times, and she was so very wicked
that they refused to have her there again. They said it was
of no use trying to reclaim her. I well remember the night
that the Lord sent me to the jail to hold a meeting. The
service was held after dark, as the prisoners were compelled
to work during the day. I was intensely grieved
and very much burdened over the case of this poor girl. So
intelligent, yet so sinful! In my grief, I fell upon the floor
weeping over her lost condition.</p>

<p>A sister who was with me, and on her way then to India,
prayed for me as well as for the poor prisoners, and
the lost girl. The meeting closed, and the next day we left
the city, the sister going west, while I started north.</p>

<p>After we left Ft. Worth, my heart was still sad and
greatly pained for the poor lost girl I had seen in the jail
and I wrote to the superintendent of the Rescue Home and
pleaded with her to try her just once more&mdash;not only for
my sake, but for the sake of Jesus. She did so, and the
result was that the girl was saved and began a life of virtue
and usefulness.</p>

<p>A year or so later, I was again at Ft. Worth, and was
holding services in the Girls' Rescue Home. As they assembled
for the meeting I shook hands with each of them.
I said of one of the girls to the matron, "This girl looks
like a good Christian&mdash;who is she?" The girl herself replied,
"Don't you know me, mother?" I said, "No." Then she
answered, "I am the girl you rescued from the prison;"
and the matron said that she was the best girl in the home.
I went back after another year, and she was the matron's
assistant. Still later the superintendent told me that she
was a deaconess in New York, and was doing a great
work. This same lady told me how she had shortly before
come across my letter in which I begged her mother-in-law,
who was the former superintendent, to help the girl and
give her just one more chance! Oh, how wonderfully God
had answered my prayers and the yearning of my heart
that night when the burden of her soul rested so heavily
upon me!</p>


<h4>ROBBED BY HER OWN BROTHER.</h4>

<p>A lovely girl was once drugged by her deceiver and left
to bear her shame alone. She was led to a rescue home
where she was cared for. Sometime after the birth of her
child, which she dearly loved, her father died, and left her
$1,000. She was induced by her brother to come to the
city where he was living, and give him the money, which he
and his wife used recklessly. They then moved, leaving the
poor girl sitting on the steps without money enough even to
buy milk for her babe. The poor girl was almost distracted
with grief. I found her a temporary home with Christian
people and a little later secured transportation for her to a
rescue home in another city where she could be kindly provided
for.</p>

<p>In that hour of despair, when I found her, she was almost
ready to yield to the enemy of her soul, through temptation
of the same wretch who had first effected her ruin.
She could go hungry herself, she said, but she could not
see her babe suffer for want of food.</p>

<p>Sisters, let us try by all possible means to befriend our
own sex and help all who are thrown in our way, heavenward.</p>


<h4>NEGLECTED BY THE CHURCHES.</h4>

<p>I once went to a city where there are many churches
and professors of religion, and yet there in the Home for
Fallen Girls, where I held services I found the inmates neglected.
I then went to the poorhouse where over a hundred
poor and crippled destitute people were so glad to hear
me sing hymns while they partook of their dinner. They
seemed to wonder who and what I was, yet, how glad they
were when they understood it was for the love of their souls
Jesus had sent me to tell them of His great love. Thank
God for the privilege of going to these places. God always
finds a way when there seems to be no way.</p>

<p>So I must say in concluding that of all those who have
my sympathy and my help, my prayers and my tears, prisoners,
and all, the poor, abandoned, forsaken girl, who has
no one to share her sorrow and her shame claims and receives
my deepest sympathy and assistance. There is no
one on whom Jesus had more compassion and yet the croakers
are often the ones to send her to worse shame by their
neglect and cruelty. Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn
thee, go and sin no more."</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"She is more to be pitied than censured,</span>
<span class="i1">She is more to be loved than despised,</span>
<span class="i0">She is only a poor girl who has ventured</span>
<span class="i1">On life's rugged path ill-advised.</span>
<span class="i0">Don't scorn her with words fierce and bitter,</span>
<span class="i1">Don't laugh at her shame and downfall;</span>
<span class="i0">Just pause for a moment, consider</span>
<span class="i1">That a man was the cause of it all."</span>
</div>


<h4>VISIT TO A HOSPITAL.</h4>

<p>One Sunday, years ago, I visited a hospital in a certain
city and found it in a most terrible condition. There were
many sick, both men and women, and how glad they were
to see me! The public were not permitted inside the
grounds, but the superintendent being absent I was admitted.
The patients were suffering with hunger, and were in
a most filthy condition.</p>

<p>I found both colored men and women in the same room
and all covered with body lice. One old colored woman
was almost eaten alive with vermin, and starving. They
would not give her even a drink of water. I gave her
water and she drank a quart and begged for more. I
asked her if she would like to have me bring her something
to eat. She said, "Oh, yes, Honey." I said, "What can
you eat?" She said, "A crust of bread&mdash;I's so hungry, been
hungry so long."</p>

<p>My heart was sick at the sights and sounds of suffering
and anguish. I told the Lord about it. All night I cried
and prayed. I got up early, got a large, fat chicken, made
soup, got provisions and a couple to help me carry the
things, and went to that miserable place. I got access to
the building with my food and all got a share. I never
will forget the looks on the faces of those starving sufferers,
and the tears coursing down their wan, pale cheeks,
as I and dear Mary, my helper, fed them. One poor old
white brother said he was ashamed to have us near him.</p>

<p>I took along clothing for the poor old colored woman,
and had to take the scissors and cut the garment off from
her, and put it in the stove. I found the mattress decaying
under her.</p>

<p>I told the superintendent's wife I would be a witness
against her in the day of judgment for treating the patients
so cruelly. She said she did not have help. I said the
state, county or city would send help, that that was no excuse
for their starving and cruelly treating those sick helpless
invalids. The old woman and the men told me they
were compelled to live there in that one room altogether.
It was terrible!</p>

<p>One man said he had killed vermin until he was so tired
and weak he could do no more. They said that seldom
ever any one left that death hole alive. The bodies were
sold for dissection.</p>

<p>I went early the next morning to the judge's office to
relate my experience and ask him if something could not
be done to relieve the suffering of the patients that I found
there in such a filthy condition and in such need of care
and food and water. I told him I did not see the superintendent,
Mr. V. Just at that moment a dudish young fellow
in the room arose and said, "So you did not see V.
when you went there yesterday; you see him now, don't
you?" He was very angry and said I got inside by his
absence, and that he would do so and so. The judge said
angrily, "Woman, you talk too much." I said, "I have not
begun to talk yet." The two men hissed and told me to
leave the office. I had taken the precaution to take with
me the sister who was traveling with me at that time, also
the young man who had helped us to carry the clothes and
provisions to the hospital the day before. They could have
corroborated my testimony but the judge was evidently in
league with the superintendent of the hospital and would
not listen.</p>

<p>I went to a church in the place to a Woman's Missionary
meeting and got permission to speak to the ladies in public
about the awful conditions I found in their so-called hospital.
They were surprised and greatly incensed, and told
their husbands, and so there was awakened an interest that
resulted in further investigation. Facts were found as I
had stated, only, if anything, worse.</p>

<p>The outcome of these things being brought to light was
that the old shanties which served as a so-called hospital
were replaced by good buildings and kind caretakers took
the place of the cruel superintendent&mdash;who died some
months later after a long illness.</p>


<h4>ANOTHER VISIT TO A HOSPITAL.</h4>

<p>The following is a description of a visit to another hospital,
as published in a paper at Chattanooga, Tenn. This
was also early in my work.</p>


<h4>A BAT CAVE.</h4>

<p class="center">A SANITARIUM FOR CATS AND HOTEL FOR DOGS&mdash;CALLED BY COURTESY
THE CITY HOSPITAL OF CHATTANOOGA.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs. E. R. Wheaton, the eloquent female evangelist, who has been
in the city for the past week carrying on a series of prayer meetings
in the jails and houses of ill fame, came into the <cite>Commercial</cite> office
yesterday afternoon and gave a full and detailed report of the neglected
condition of the city hospital. She says:</p>

<p>"As I approached the building I could not convince myself that I
was really in sight of a hospital, for it reminded me more of a stable
than anything else I could conceive of. I approached the gate and
met a colored female mute who raised her hand in a deprecating manner
as if to warn me of some unseen danger that I was about to
come in contact with. I motioned the negro girl to lead the way
and followed her into a dreary looking house that I had been told
was really the only hospital of which Chattanooga could boast. Just
as I opened the door six big hounds sprang from the different beds
within the building and would have torn me to pieces had not I
hastily slammed the door and shut them in. I applied to a poor
cripple man who had the appearance of a half-fed mendicant where
to find the keeper and I was informed that he was asleep, but if I
would wait he (the cripple) would go and wake him up, and in a few
moments he returned accompanied by a healthy looking man who
seemed to care little whether I went in or remained out of doors in
the rain.</p>

<p>"As I followed the keeper into the room six well fed hounds and
one emaciated looking man occupied the beds that were in the rooms.</p>

<p>"I have wandered from one end of the land to the other, I have
visited prison cells, opium joints, houses of ill-fame, almshouses, reformatories
and every dreary den from New York to San Francisco,
from Florida to Montreal, but with all the sights with which I have
been confronted I have never seen a more cheerless abode and one so
utterly void of comfort and cleanliness as the one occupied by the
poor, hungry invalid that shared the beds of the well fed dogs.</p>

<p>"The sick man said he was suffering for the want of food and
had been shamefully neglected since he was placed in charge of the
manager of this cheerless institution. Two inmates have died within
the past week and two are left to suffer.</p>

<p>"The other inmate was a colored man who evidently has little
more of life's suffering to endure in this world.</p>

<p>"In this room six cats occupied seats of prominence, two purring
on one bed and three others romping from place to place over the
apartment, while the sixth was helping himself to the sick man's
dinner.</p>

<p>"The buildings are without warmth in the winter and have no
means of ventilation for summer. The confined air is contaminated
with the odor that rises from unemptied and neglected vessels that
are allowed to stand neglected from day to day. The keeper seems
to be utterly indifferent with regard to the ease or comfort of the
sick and it is very evident that while the city pays for food to support
the sick and suffering, the countless and useless dogs and cats
eat a large portion of the food which should be used exclusively for
the unfortunate inmates."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton has done much commendable work not only in Chattanooga
but from one end of the land to the other. She has consecrated
her time, wealth and character to the uplifting of fallen
people, and by her devotion to Christianity and her liberality has won
thousands of friends throughout the country.&mdash;Chattanooga Paper.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dear Brother: This will introduce to you Mrs. Elizabeth Wheaton,
a prison evangelist. She is alone and unprotected in London. Please

New York, October 16, 1903.
</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with Mrs. Elizabeth Wheaton was made in
the Florence Crittenton Midnight Mission, New York City, in 1890.
She impressed me then and has ever since as one whom God has
called and endowed with special gifts for a grand and noble work.
Her one strong hold is faith in God. When under the power of the
Spirit she verily treads upon serpents and scorpions and all the powers
of darkness seem to flee before her. As a singing evangelist
for prison work, I do not know her equal. Her preaching is in the
demonstration of the Spirit and with power. She gives the Lord's
message with holy boldness, fraught with tender love to the sinner,
and blessed are the results.</p>

<p>The midnight call given on train, when it was my privilege to be
with her, was an hour never to be forgotten. Many will rise up and
call her blessed in that great day who but for her favored and wonderful
ministry would have gone into outer darkness. God bless her
and her book.</p>

<p>The following taken from "Beulah Home Record," Chicago,
Ill., March 1, 1902, is explanatory in itself. Also the
letter that follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have had with us for a time, as our honored guest, Mother
Wheaton, the Railroad Prison Evangelist. Like Jesus, the friend of
poor sinners, she goes up and down the land in state prisons and
homes where mothers' girls are sheltered, down into the coal mines,
into the great lumber camps, and on crowded railroad trains, while
speeding along, she preaches the everlasting gospel of our Lord and
Savior, and gives out tracts. Thus she goes as God's flaming minister,
sowing beside all waters, singing and praying poor sin-sick,
tempest-tossed souls into the kingdom of God. Do you ask what is
the secret of her success? It may be found in the Psalms, 126:6&mdash;"She
goeth forth weeping," she has a burning love for souls. So
you and I, dear reader, if we are to succeed in winning souls, our
hearts must be full of love for them. We give Mother Wheaton a
warm welcome to this great and wicked city of Chicago and a hearty
welcome always to Beulah Home.</p></blockquote>

<p>We feel in Berachah Home that we shall not forget Mother Wheaton.
She came into the "Home" and our lives just as God was
leading us out in rescue work, and as she stood among us in our
first "open meeting," we felt, "Here is a strong, brave soldier of the
cross." We found hope and encouragement as she spoke to us of
His service, and the Spirit witnessed "This is of God," as she sang
one of her songs as only Mother Wheaton can sing them. We did not
see her again until in the Baltimore Convocation of Prayer, January,
1904, when God again used her to bring Mrs. Chapman and me to
God's full thought for us there. She with others laid hands on us,
with prayer, setting us apart for the "work whereunto we were
called." May God bless her ministry to others, as He has to us in
Berachah Home.</p>

<h3>Work in Canada and Mexico.</h3>


<p>In my several visits to the prisons of Canada I have
generally found the officers very courteous. There are
sometimes there, as here, changes of administration, making
the work of reaching the prisoners more difficult. In the
large prison at Toronto the officers were especially kind
and gave me the privilege of preaching the gospel to the
prisoners as often as I could attend chapel services. Much
interest was manifested and I trust good was accomplished.</p>


<h4>MY SECOND EXPERIENCE IN STREET PREACHING</h4>

<p>was in Hamilton, Canada. There for weeks, night after
night, rain or shine, I sang and preached the gospel in the
open air. I was especially helped of the Lord and met with
blessed success.</p>

<p>In 1886, I took with me from Toronto, a dear young sister,
who was called of God to join me in my work. She
went with me to Florida and many other states. She afterward
married an evangelist but died a few years later, being
true to God, so far as I know, to the last.</p>


<h4>SERVICE WITH Y. M. C. A.</h4>

<p>During a visit to London, Canada, after visiting the
prisons I went to the hospital to visit the sick. While singing,
a message came over the telephone saying that the Secretary
of the Y. M. C. A. requested me to lead their meeting
on Sunday afternoon. Would I come? I said, "Better wait
till I return to the city. I can't tell." The secretary had to
know at once, so he could announce it through the papers.
So I promised to go, as they had no speaker. I felt discouraged,
as I could think of no message suitable for that
large, mixed audience, and prayed for guidance. Sunday
afternoon&mdash;still with no message in mind&mdash;I started to the
hall. As I walked along the street, praying, I said, "Lord,
give me at least a text to read." Just then I saw on the
ground a scrap of paper, the torn leaf of a Bible. I picked
it up, looked at it, and there my message, text and all,
opened up to my mental vision. I went into the pulpit depending
entirely on God, and the light broke in on my soul,
and the power of God fell on the people. I told them how I
was depending alone on the Lord for the words as He gave
them to me. It was a victorious meeting. I leave results
with the Lord.</p>


<h4>A GIRL RESCUED.</h4>

<p>In one of the Canadian cities I found in the jail a beautiful
girl who was very dissipated and unruly. The officers
could not control her&mdash;no one had any good influence over
her. The Lord laid the burden of her soul on my heart. I
treated her with love and respect, and tried in every way
to win her for God. Finally, she realized that I loved her
soul, though no one else cared for her. Then she sought
the Lord. She was a Roman Catholic. I told her I would
go to the House of the Good Shepherd and speak to the
Mother Superior, and see if they would not take her in, as
she had no home. She wept with joy at this, and told me
of a plan some wicked men had made to be at the jail when
she was discharged at 6 o'clock Saturday evening and take
her to haunts of sin. I hurried out to the Sisters early in
the morning and found them at mass, and waited, determined
to save the poor girl from further downfall, and
drunkenness. The Sisters, seeing my anxiety and sincerity,
agreed to help me. Then I went to the officers of the jail
and got them to release the girl at noon. She was taken to
another city and thus saved. When the hour came for her
release from the jail in the evening, sure enough several
men made their appearance and watched and waited for her
to come out. At last they began calling her name. Then
the officers went out and told them the girl had been pardoned,
and had left at noon for another city, with protectors.
Another brand had been plucked from the burning for the
Master's Kingdom.</p>


<h4>SHUT OUT&mdash;OTHERS ADMITTED.</h4>

<p>At one time amidst great inconveniences I reached
Kingston Prison. I saw some of the officers Saturday
night and they were kind and willingly consented that I
should have opportunity to hold or assist in services the
next day. The next morning I went to the prison through
a drenching rain&mdash;without an umbrella, arrived early and
waited for the chaplain. When he came, I told him my desire
and what the other officers had said. But he refused to
even let me go inside to listen to the service. When I asked
his reason he said they would not allow women in the prison.
Yet while I had been waiting I had seen several Catholic
sisters enter. I have had similar experiences in our own
land.</p>


<h4>STONED.</h4>

<p>One day as I was passing along the street in the quaint
walled city of Quebec, some boys threw stones at me, while
an old man urged them on, saying, "If it's Salvation Army
ye are, ye should be killed." The Lord have mercy upon
them and upon all who oppose His work or His workers.
For ourselves we must not count these things strange. "It
is enough for the disciple that he be as his Master, and the
servant as his Lord."</p>


<h4>AN INFIDEL DEFEATED.</h4>

<p>While in Toronto, Canada, I often went to the parks
on Sabbath days and held services&mdash;the mayor of the city,
who was a devoted Christian, often himself helping in these
open-air services. One stand in the park was usually occupied
by the infidel element. They would hold the place all
day so that others could not have the privilege of doing
work for God&mdash;so as the place was public property upon
which they had no rightful claim I went early and so secured
the place before them. When their leader arrived the
people were listening to the gospel in song and testimony
from worthy witnesses. He was very angry&mdash;said it was
his place to speak and he must have it, and ordered me to
stop and leave the stand, but I kept on with the service as
God directed and he went away a few steps and called for
the people to follow him, and he would address them. No
one seemed inclined to go and a bystander told him his followers
were few and he had better desist from trying to
disturb a religious service. So we had the victory and God
was honored that day in the work which He sent his servants
to do.</p>

<p>Among my papers I have found the following letters of
introduction given me while in Canada by Hon. John
Robson, Provincial Secretary:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">

<h4>WORK IN MEXICO.</h4>

<p>Not many years after engaging in special prison work I
went into Mexico and have since gone there quite frequently.
As a rule the people are ignorant and superstitious
and consequently hard to reach with the gospel. But
though I was compelled to speak through an interpreter it
is surprising how soon they know if one is sincere and
earnest. In the prisons they are very poorly cared for,
often having to wait years for trial and sometimes dying
of neglect. I am told that natives of our own land if thrown
into prison there fare worse than others.</p>


<h4>A BULL FIGHT.</h4>

<p>Once while in Mexico I found there was to be a bull
fight not far from the prison where I was to hold service.
My heart was sad because of the intense anxiety of the
Mexicans to see the exhibition. They came long distances
and there were many very old people who seemed impatient
for the hour to arrive when Mexicans, bulls and horses
should be thrown helplessly together&mdash;that they might view
the combat. This cruel sport&mdash;so long a favorite pastime
both in Spain and Mexico&mdash;was at one time abolished but
was afterward re-established out of policy&mdash;in order to
please the Mexicans. For me to describe this kind of fiendish
pastime would not glorify God, nor help the public, but
would have a tendency to brutality, being neither elevating
nor refining. But should we not, dear reader, try to do all
in our power to lead people to a higher plane of morals and
send missionaries to help people to know Jesus who satisfies
every longing of the human soul, and gives peace and rest
here, and a home in Heaven through eternity?</p>


<h4>SIX UNDER DEATH SENTENCE.</h4>

<p>At another time I visited a prison in Mexico where there
were six men under death sentence. They could not understand
me, but I knelt by those great, strong men and wept
and prayed to God who could carry the message of love
through my tears to their hard hearts and they were so affected
that we all wept together. I am sure they were remembered
that day by the God who sent me to show them
<em>His</em> love for the lost and who gave me a love for the poor
criminals that nothing can destroy.</p>


<h4>DIFFICULTIES.</h4>

<p>During my last trip into Mexico, 1902, I found the prisoners
in one place in a most deplorable condition. They
were almost starving and neglected in every way. I had
considerable trouble in getting into the prison on that day,
as I could find no one to interpret for me. So we went from
one office to another trying to find some one to admit us
to the prison. As I entered one public office a fierce dog
came rushing at me from an adjoining room. I fled out
of the door in dismay with the dog and an old Mexican
woman at my heels. I tried to make her understand what
we wanted and then hurried away. Finally we found a
fellow decorated beyond description with tinsel and other
adornings who furnished me an interpreter and admitted
us to the prison. It was very difficult to make the poor
prisoners understand how deeply I felt for them, but I could
put my arms around the poor women who were there and
I could take their little babes in my arms and thus show
my sympathy, then telling the story of Jesus who said,
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p>


<h4>MINISTERED TO A SUFFERER.</h4>

<p>I found one poor wounded man who had just been
brought into the prison sitting on the ground with bloody
clothing and matted hair. He was weeping and tried so
hard to explain something to me. The interpreter was evidently
slow to tell me what the poor sufferer wanted. I was
heart-sick to know what to do, as we had only a short time
to stay and I could not bear to leave him without in some
way ministering to him. But I thought of the fruit remaining
in my handbag. I thrust an orange into his bony hands.
He grabbed it and with both hands thrust it to his mouth
eating peel and all. Poor man&mdash;he was evidently starving.
Reader I wish I could make clear to you the pitiful sight!
The sequel showed me why that was providentially left in
my handbag. How thankful I was to minister to that
poor fellow's need in even a small degree. How I longed
to help them all.</p>

<h3>Across the Sea.</h3>


<p>I had greatly desired to preach the gospel in other lands
and held myself ever ready to go at a moment's warning,
anywhere the Lord should lead, and had been given letters
of introduction to prominent people in Great Britain. In
the year 1890 my mind was much exercised about the regions
beyond&mdash;and without time for preparation, with but
an hour's notice, the call came to go forward. I was in
Philadelphia walking along the street praying&mdash;"O Lord,
where next&mdash;what wilt Thou have me to do?" Looking
up I saw the large posters of steamship lines and the thought
came to me, "Go and inquire the price of a ticket to Europe."
I obeyed the impulse and went in and talked with
the steamship agent of rates and the time of departure of
the first steamer. Then I left the office praying, O God,
show me Thy will&mdash;make Thy way very plain to me. Then
I went back to the office, feeling that I must get alone with
the Lord. I asked the agent if I might go into a rear office
which was unoccupied, to pray. He very courteously replied,
"Certainly, madam." There I knelt before the Lord
and inquired if He wanted me to go at once&mdash;that very night&mdash;on
the first steamer, to Scotland. The answer came clearly:
"Go, my child, nothing doubting." I arose, went into
the front office and explained to the agent the nature of my
mission work; and how for years I had obeyed the leadings
of the Holy Spirit and that I had a sister traveling with me
who was waiting at the depot for my return, to know where
we would go next. Told him I would buy two steerage
tickets for Glasgow, Scotland, if he would refund the money
for the one in case the sister was unwilling to go with me.
To this he consented, so I purchased the tickets and hurried
to the railway station where I had left my friend. I
knew we had only a few moments to catch the train for
New York in order to reach the steamer Devonia for Glasgow.
Hurriedly I said to her, "Do you want to go to Europe?"
"Oh, yes," she replied. "When?" I asked. "Oh,
some time," was the answer. Then I said, "I have two tickets.
It is now or never. If you wish to go I will take you,
if not, I will go alone and you can return the ticket and
get the money for yourself." She said, "I will go." So
we rushed to the gate, caught the train on the move, and
reached New York in time to get aboard the Devonia.</p>


<h4>ON THE OCEAN.</h4>

<p>Leaving America's shores far behind us, we found ourselves
doomed to a stormy voyage, but with plenty of missionary
work to do. There was, in the steerage, much profanity,
continual drunkenness of both men and women, and
card playing at all times only when the passengers were
sleeping or too sea-sick. While in mid-ocean we encountered
a severe storm which greatly delayed us. There were
only six Christians on board the steamer. I believe it was
in answer to prayer that the ship was saved from wreck.
After thirteen days on the ocean, we saw the shores of
"Bonnie Scotland," and as we neared port there was great
rejoicing among the passengers&mdash;almost all of whom were
going home. But how different it was with me! I felt
much as Paul did when he said to the elders of the church
at Ephesus, "And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit
unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me
there: save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city,
saying that bonds and afflictions abide me." Like him I
felt that suffering and persecution and perhaps imprisonment
and death was before me in that strange land, but
Paul was enabled to say, "But none of these things move
me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I
might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I
have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of
the grace of God;" and with something of the same spirit
I was enabled to say, as I wept before Him, "Lord, I will
be true&mdash;only give me Thy grace sufficient for me."</p>


<h4>IN A FOREIGN LAND.</h4>

<p>I was a stranger in a strange land with only a few shillings
and without any great degree of strength of body and,
strange to say, for one reason and another I never saw one
of those to whom I carried letters of introduction. How
the Lord was teaching me not to lean on the arm of flesh!
In answer to a letter of inquiry written to one to whom one
letter was addressed, I received the following very kind
reply from her husband:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
11 Walker St.,<br />
Edinburgh, Oct. 18, 1890.</p>

<p>Dear Friend:
</p>

<p>Your letter of the 16th, with one from Miss Sisson, has just
reached me, forwarded from Crieff. Since Miss Sisson's letter was
written my dear wife has fallen asleep in Jesus and having left
Crieff I am in lodgings for the present in Edinburgh with my
sister and five children.</p>

<p>I have been praying over the subject of your letter, but I do
not have any light on the matter nor am I likely, so far as I can
see, to be in Glasgow for some time. Yet if the Lord sent you to
Scotland He will certainly show you what He has for you to do.
"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own
understanding: in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall
direct thy paths."</p>

<p>I enclose a one-pound note towards expenses.</p>

<p class="center">
Yours in Christ,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">G. W. Oldham</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>At the landing in Glasgow, I inquired of the policeman
on duty and secured a room with his family. Then I went
in search of a meeting. Found the car-fare a penny a mile
and other customs quite different from ours. The first
meeting I found corresponded to our Y. M. C. A. meetings.
But our special mission was to the lost.</p>

<p>That evening I received permission from the policeman
to hold open-air meetings. Going along the street a woman
who was drunk spied me and rushed after me beating
me on the back. As I made no resistance other drunken
women joined their companion in sin and I would have
had a hard time of it had not the police protected me.
These drunken women thought that I belonged to the Salvation
Army, as the bonnet I then wore was quite similar
to the one dear Mother Booth had worn and I was often
told that I looked like her. I was in Scotland when she
passed to her reward in the land where there are no slums,
no sinners to rescue, to weep over and save. Had I been
near enough how gladly would I have joined the great
throng that gathered to show honor to her memory! Nearly
every night while in Glasgow found us on the streets
preaching, singing, and praying, with those who never
went to church&mdash;many of them not even to the Salvation
Army or missions. In many respects we found worse conditions
than in our home-land. The public houses were always
filled at night with men and often their whole families&mdash;drinking
all kinds of intoxicants&mdash;women with infants
in their arms as well as others drinking with men at the
bar. And the most beautiful girls to be found were secured
by the keepers of these houses to stand behind the
bar and sell the drinks.</p>

<p>The prisons, my special burden, I found very difficult of
access for missionary work. I found that women were not
expected, there, to do that kind of work. Yet I fasted and
prayed and wept before the Lord, pleading that the prison
doors might be opened to me and at last I was successful
in gaining admission to some of them. After some delay
I was admitted to Duke Street jail, in Glasgow, and there
held several services. It is a large prison, filled with the
baser sort and those whom the public houses had been licensed
to make drunkards&mdash;to cause to reel and stagger
and abuse and kill when unconscious of what they were
doing. The Lord's presence was revealed in our services
there and souls got help from God, and I hope to meet
many of them in heaven. We visited the poor in their
homes, different penal institutions&mdash;all of the missions and
Salvation Army Corps and many of the churches. While
time lasts we will find much to do to help those around us.</p>


<h4>MY LIFE IN DANGER.</h4>

<p>Oftentimes my life was in danger when visiting the saloons,
which are there called public houses&mdash;the keepers
being called publicans. Often the keepers of brothels and
other places of sin drew revolvers on me&mdash;threatening me
with death if I did not leave, as they did not want to lose
their customers and their money&mdash;which they were sure
to do if souls were converted there, but the Lord always
delivered me when death stared me in the face. One day
I went into a public house where a woman kept a dive.
She at once got very angry, demanded my business, and ordered
me to leave her place. She clutched me with a fiendish
grip, and pushed me out of the door, but purposely
fastened one of my arms in the door as she slammed it
shut. I prayed God to release me and with the help of the
sister who was with me we got the door open enough to
release my arm. I am sorry to have reason to say that, as
a rule, I find the women who are in charge of brothels and
saloons harder to deal with than the men. A woman of
judgment and tact when fully saved can, in many cases, do
more good than men from the fact that she can go where
very few men could go without being looked upon with
suspicion. What need, then, that we should be emptied of
self and filled with the Holy Spirit, all given up to the Lord
in order that we can work successfully for God and souls.</p>

<p>One Saturday night, while in Glasgow, I preached in a
church. Great crowds had turned out in the city spending
their week's wages. There was much drinking of both
men and women. At the church was given a "Penny Tea,"
consisting of a cup of tea and a biscuit, thus drawing the
crowds&mdash;and afterwards having some one preach to them.</p>


<h4>A SONG STOPS A ROW.</h4>

<p>When the services had closed, we were returning to our
lodging and were attracted by a great crowd of people engaged
in a row and a fight. I soon saw there was danger
of bloodshed and stepping out in the street I began to sing
an old time hymn. This drew the attention of many and
they came running to hear. Then I talked to them of Jesus
and His love, and we went on our way and held another
service on another street. Then, coming to the quarters of
a company of firemen, I asked if I might hold a service
with them some time. One of them replied, "Yes, why not
now?" It was then 10 o'clock and raining. I stepped into
the street and began singing. Across the way there was a
dance hall with dancing going on upon the three floors of
the hall. As I sang, the windows of the hall were lowered
with a crash, perhaps to keep out the rain&mdash;perhaps to keep
out the sound of my voice.</p>

<p>As we proceeded with the service a policeman soon appeared
and ordered me to stop. I told him I was not violating
any ordinance of the city and only holding the service
at the request of these firemen. He was angry and threatened
to arrest us. He soon returned with two other officers,
and while the sister who was with me was speaking,
he took her by the arm and led her down the muddy street.
I began singing, "He is able to deliver thee." The other
two policemen took me by the arms and forced me through
the deep mud in the street quite a long distance to the jail.
Before being placed in the cell I was asked the cause of our
arrest. I replied, "For holding open-air service on the
street, and there is no law in Scotland to forbid us from
doing so." We were placed in a room under guard to
await the decision. We could hear the shrieks of men and
women delirious from drink.</p>

<p>I was asked who we were, and replied, "We have come
from America to preach the gospel." After cross-questioning
and severely reprimanding me they asked if I would
hold my peace if they would let me go. I answered, "I do
not wish to disregard your request, but I must obey God,
for that is why I am here. And according to your law it is
no crime to hold open-air services; and it is a custom with
the churches." "Then we will put you into the cell." Another
said, "No, we cannot do that for this offense." Then
he said I should be gone. I said, "Will you not send an
officer to show us the way to our lodging, as you have arrested
us without a cause and it is late at night?" But
they refused to send a guide. I asked if they would give
me the name of the policeman who arrested us, and told
them the matter was not yet ended; that they did not know
with whom they were dealing. At first they refused to
give me the names asked for; but I said I should stay till
they did so, and I prevailed. When we had started to try
to find our way to our lodging place, we met a lady who
kindly directed us to the street and number.</p>

<p>On Monday a sister who had been preaching among the
policemen for some years, called to see me&mdash;having heard
of my arrest and treatment. She was much surprised and
said she could have those policemen all discharged for their
conduct toward me. I said, "No, do not do that; I only
want to see them and talk to them about their souls' salvation."
"Then," she replied, "I will have them come and
ask your forgiveness." As she started away, I handed her
some recommendations and railroad passes I had had in
America and letters of introduction to parties in that land.
Glancing over them she exclaimed, "Is it possible? A lady
with such a recommend! These letters are addressed to
some of the best people in Great Britain. Will you trust
me with these till I return?" "Certainly," I replied. She
returned in due time, saying the policemen would come
and make an apology. I was very glad, for I felt then that
I could tell them it was the love of Christ for the lost ones
of earth that constrained me to speak on the streets. Many
ladies called during the day to give me their sympathy and
show their interest. The policeman who caused the arrest
came and asked me to forgive him. He bowed with us in
prayer, and sobs shook his heavy frame while his tears fell
like rain. He said, "It is like mother used to talk, and it is
the same kind of religion she had in olden times." I believe
that man found Christ his Savior that day. He told us of
his wife sick at home and two "wee bairns," and as he
could get no girl at home, he had overworked; and on that
Saturday night had taken too much liquor in order to keep
him awake.</p>

<p>He invited me to call upon his family. This I did the
following day, and found it as he had said. The two other
men that had a part in arresting us came the following day.
One of them seemed very penitent when I talked to them,
and both humbly begged my pardon for their conduct toward
me.</p>

<p>While in Glasgow I was invited by General Evans, of the
Gospel Army, to conduct special services for ten nights at
their hall&mdash;commonly known as the Globe Theater. We
copy the following from an editorial of the General's published
in his paper while we were there:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Hearing of these evangelists we decided to invite them to
Globe Theater, and truly we can say God has visited his people.
They do not believe in forms and ceremonies like us formal Scotch
Christians, but speak as they are moved by the Holy Ghost. They
live by faith and do not ask for money or collections; however,
they seem to get on very well, and I never yet heard them grumbling
about having too little. They take whatever is given them
as from the Lord, and give Him their sincere thanks accordingly.
They have spent over a week speaking and singing every night in
our meetings, and not a few have been impressed by the earnest
words of our sisters. Some of the professors have had their short-comings
pretty well threshed out, the writer coming in for his
share. Our meetings have been well attended and I believe a really
good work has been begun in our midst. The elder lady carries
about with her a book full of newspaper clippings and numerous
testimonials about her work in America. Her special field is in
the prisons and among the unfortunates. She takes no stock in
sensational worship, but there is always a great sensation wherever
she puts in an appearance.... In closing I may say that our
heaven-bound sisters have had some severe trials since leaving
their native shores. Eternity alone will reveal the amount they
have endured for the Master's sake. Before they had been many
hours in Glasgow they were marched off to jail for preaching at a
street corner, and gathering a crowd. I trust this epistle will open
up our cold, hard hearts and that we may receive our sisters as is
our duty as a Christian community."</p></blockquote>


<h4>TUMULT IN A DIVE.</h4>

<p>"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold the
devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried; * *
* Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life."&mdash;Rev.
2:10.</p>

<p>One Sunday night, as I was on my way going from the
meeting, being in company with General Evans and his
wife and the sister who traveled with me, I saw a public
house open and went in and began to speak to the men and
women. I had only talked a few minutes when the proprietor
came in and asked, "Are you a customer here?" I replied,
"No, I am only speaking to these people about their
souls." He said, "Now you leave, or I'll make you." He
ran into a back room, and coming out he passed me quickly,
running to the door and blowing a long blast on a police
whistle. This aroused the people and brought to the scene
several policemen and hundreds of people of all classes in
general fright. A man rushed in and catching me by the
arm cried, "Come out of this place, quick, or you'll be
killed. You are in danger. You don't know where you
are! This is the Gallow Gate; the worst place in Glasgow."
I said to him, "Let me alone, I am obeying God." But as
the policemen closed in around me there was a cry raised,
"It is Jack the Ripper in disguise." The excitement in
those days was intense all over Europe. Jack the Ripper
was a fiend in human form that was killing women continually
in the most horrifying manner and in cold blood.
You might see on a bulletin board in the city that a murder
would be committed on such a day and hour and these
threats would be carried out. Yet he defied the detectives
and police. Large rewards were offered for his capture. I
saw that my life was in danger unless I could convince
them of their mistake, of which I now saw the cause. I
was dressed differently from them. I had on a long black
cloak and had thrown my black shawl over my head concealing
my bonnet, and carried a bag on my arm which
contained my recommendations, railway passes, etc. I
said: "You are mistaken, gentlemen, I am not Jack the
Ripper" (removing my shawl), "I am a missionary from
America; and preaching at the Globe Theater every night.
Come and hear me there. There is no cause for this tumult."
The General and his wife having come in, we
passed out, the mob following us several blocks with shouts
and screams giving me some blows as we went. But God
delivered us from their cruel hands.</p>


<h4>A MOB OF DRUNKEN WOMEN.</h4>

<p>Another night when returning from the Globe Theater
in company with General and Mrs. Evans we heard a great
noise up the street and soon discovered that it was made
by a mob of some kind. On their coming nearer, we found
it was an immense crowd of drunken fallen girls. The
General said: "Hide yourselves quick! There is no telling
what they might do." The policemen had slunk away&mdash;not
caring to try to make any arrests, as there were so
many of them and they were so violent. Poor souls! They
were some mothers' girls who perhaps had learned to love
the taste of strong drink before they saw the light and were
bound by both inherited and acquired appetite. I was told
that on an average there were four drunken women in
Glasgow for every drunken man. Such a statement seems
beyond belief, but during our stay we saw much to indicate
that it was true. What could the harvest be?</p>

<p>While in Scotland I received a very precious letter of encouragement
and sympathy from Col. Geo. R. Clarke and
wife of Pacific Garden Mission, Chicago. I give it here
and the reader can easily realize how comforting it proved
to me.</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Chicago, October 29, 1890.</p>

<p>My Dear Sister Wheaton:
</p>

<p>We received yours written from Glasgow last night. I am sorry
they treat you so badly there. But that is the way nice appearing
people treated our blessed Lord when on earth, and the way they
would treat Him now should He come to earth in the flesh. But it is
blessed to us, said Jesus, when men persecute us. We have a right
then to rejoice as He told us.</p>

<p>The Lord will stand by you as He did by Paul. He "will never
leave you nor forsake you." So you can boldly say: "The Lord
is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."</p>

<p>The Lord's work is prospering at our Mission and we are much
encouraged in it. We have large meetings and many precious souls
for Christ every night.</p>

<p>We have started a noonday prayer-meeting for both sexes. The
Lord is greatly blessing the meetings. We have souls converted there
right along at every meeting.</p>

<p>We will pray for you and may the dear Lord greatly bless you in
your work and labor of love which you do in His name.</p>

<p>We have only a little time left now to wait for Him. The signs
are thickening and He will soon rush into view and then we shall
hear Him say, "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou
in to the joy of thy Lord." Praise His dear name. Glory to God!
Hallelujah!!! What a meeting that will be! It will be our time
to laugh then, but our persecutors will weep and wail. May God
be merciful to them now and give them repentance before that awful
day.</p>

<p>Don't be in a hurry to die and go to heaven. You are more needed
by the Lord down here just now than in heaven. There are no sinners
there to whom to preach His gospel and He tells us to "Go and
preach" not "go to heaven." He will take us all home in His own
good time. Let us patiently wait for Him and "occupy until He
comes." With much Christian love we are yours in Christ.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Col. and Mrs. Geo. R. Clarke.</span>
</p></blockquote>


<h4>IN PAISLEY.</h4>

<p>I was summoned by telegram to go on to Paisley, Scotland,
to hold services for the Gospel Army in that place.
We went immediately. Found the city well informed of
our coming by large striking posters which read: "Hear
the American Prison Evangelists&mdash;Be sure to hear these
ladies who have preached on the ruins of the Johnstown
horror! Who have visited all the prisons of note in America&mdash;led
murderers to the scaffold," etc. I was not accustomed
to such sensational advertising and tore down the
posters I came across and chided with the General for
advertising us in such a way. He kindly explained that it
was customary in their work in order to arrest the attention
of the people and arouse interest in our meetings. Perhaps
he was right but it was something of a trial to me to
be brought before the people in that way.</p>

<p>We found much to do in Paisley, not only in the night
services but on the streets, in the homes of refuge and in
homes. Found twelve hundred girls employed in the Coats
Thread Works and eight hundred girls in Clark's Thread
Works. Found great poverty among the laboring classes,
as there was much dissipation among both men and women.</p>

<p>Just before leaving Paisley I was called to go and hold
services in the Refuge for Fallen Women. During the
services there did not seem to be much feeling concerning
their soul's salvation. It seemed I could not reach them.
At last, near the close of the meeting, I said: "Girls, I am
going away to my own land. I will never see you on earth
again. Will you not try and live so you will meet me in
heaven? If so, raise your hands." Not one hand was
raised. Then I said, "Girls, won't you pray?" No sign
yet. "Girls, shall I pray for you when far away? If so,
raise your hands?" Not a hand went up. I was almost
discouraged. Could I leave that great crowd of lost women
to go on in their awful career without at least one
manifesting a desire for a better life? How could I meet
them at the Judgment? At last I said: "Girls, I leave to-morrow
for America. I am all alone. Only this young
woman with me. How many of you will pray for <em>us</em> as we
cross the ocean again to go to our own land? If any one
will pray for us, won't you raise your hand?" <em>Every hand
went up</em>, and God's Holy Spirit crept unawares into their
hearts&mdash;so long unused to prayer, and the spell of evil was
broken, and God reached them. O the melting, tender
spirit which filled the room! And that company, I believe,
gave God their hearts. In learning to pray for us, their
sisters, they found God, and I trust to meet many, if not
all, of those dear souls in heaven. Jesus said, "Neither do
I condemn thee; go and sin no more." And then the confessions,
the tears, the promises! Bless God, His word will
not return void.</p>

<p>Shortly after my arrival in America I received the following
letter, which explains itself, from the matron of
this Home:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Female Refuge, Paisley, Scotland, March 23, 1891.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton.
</p>

<p>Dear Friend: Glad I was to know that you had in God's good
Providence arrived safe at home among your dear ones, and rejoice
also with you that the work is prospering in your hand.</p>

<p>I have been called upon to part here with dear ones since I saw
you, but they are gone before me only a little while. My assistants
are all with me yet, and with myself had much pleasure in your
card. We often talk of you and your young friend that accompanied
you. I do hope she is still with you. We have now a household of
thirty inmates, many giving proof of a new life being theirs for
time and eternity. With our united kind regards, I am</p>

<p class="center">
Yours truly in the Lord's work,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Annie J. Blue</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I have already mentioned the fact that I found it difficult
to gain admittance to the prisons of Scotland. I waited in
Edinburgh for days, on expense, seeking opportunity to
hold at least one service in the large prison there. While
waiting I held services in the jail and missions and open
air. Our meetings in the open air were largely attended,
not only by the working classes, but also by others who
would stop and listen, being attracted, at first, by the singing
which usually drew large crowds. We were much
blessed in these services and especially in the slums where
large numbers of neglected children gathered around us,
ragged and dirty, but with hearts glad to learn to sing with
us.</p>


<h4>RETURN TO AMERICA.</h4>

<p>Various circumstances combined that seemed to require
my return to America and after nearly two months of constant
toil in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Paisley, we hurried
to Liverpool and November 15 took shipping for New
York on the steamship Wisconsin. On this return voyage
we encountered another fearful storm in which many ships
went down.</p>

<p>The storm raged about four days. Men and women were
in great fear; some weeping, some screaming, some praying,
and some cursing. Among all that multitude there were
only four Christians; only four souls ready to face eternity!</p>

<p>But our God is a very present help in time of trouble.
There in that terrible hour, I was conscious of His presence
and I knew that He was able to deliver us. When
the storm had abated, with a heart full of gratitude and
thanksgiving, I tried to sing, but could only utter softly
the words of one old-time hymn:</p>

<p class="center">
"How firm a foundation ye saints of the Lord."
</p>

<p>So wonderfully did God deliver us that in spite of that
fearful storm we reached New York harbor after being
only twelve days at sea.</p>

<p>On board these steamers a religious service is held
every Lord's day, but it is usually led by the captain who
is often an ungodly man. Many seemed to ease their
guilty consciences by observing this form of religion.
But my heart was often left more hungry and sad by a
service which seemed to me mere form if not a farce and
mockery.</p>

<p>During this return trip I supposed I was about out of
money, and was somewhat tempted to doubt the promises,
and I prayed much for guidance. When almost
ready to land I took from my purse my small stock to
have the steward get it changed for U. S. money, and to
my glad surprise I found in another part of the purse a
pound note. I could not tell how it came to be there.
So I felt reproved for my lack of faith.</p>

<p>Among my old papers I find a touching letter written
by a dear young sister to whom I became much attached
while in Scotland. Had it not been that her family were
largely dependent upon her she would have gone with
me in my work. I give the following extract:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Glasgow, Nov. 17, 1890.</p>

<p>My Dear Sister in Jesus:
</p>

<p>I received your card Saturday night; and was very much surprised
to learn that you had gone so suddenly. But not our will but God's
will be done. Dear sister, I hope you and Nellie will have a safe
passage across the ocean and may the dear Savior be very present to
both of you. You have His blessed promise, "Fear them not; for I
am with thee."</p>

<p>Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash; and the husband were asking very kindly after you.
Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; could scarcely credit that you had gone home so suddenly.
Several others also in the hall wish you a special blessing
in your effort to win souls for the Master, who will reward you in
His own time.</p>

<p>Dear sister, you do not know and you will never know until you are
within the Pearly Gates, how many precious souls have been brought
to the knowledge of the truth through you.</p>

<p>May the dear Lord make us truly Holy Ghost workers and may
we have a desire to point sinners to Jesus&mdash;the all-sufficient one&mdash;the
author and finisher of our salvation. Glory to God! May we be
more and more like Jesus, humble, meek and mild, loving one another
as the Lord has also loved us. May we be clean, empty vessels for
the Master's use. Dear Jesus, do strip us of everything that would
hinder the blessing and would keep our joy from being full. Write
soon; and if we do not meet again on earth, with God's help we will
meet in heaven, Praise God!</p>

<h4>SECOND VISIT TO EUROPE.</h4>

<p>In the year 1896 the Lord made plain to me that it was
His will that I should again go to Europe. While in Washington,
D. C., I was led to return to Iowa, and there found
that a band of missionaries who were ready to start for
Africa had been praying that I might come and go with
them as far as New York. When they saw me alight at
their door, they shouted and praised the Lord. When I
asked them the reason they said because God had answered
prayer&mdash;that they had prayed God to send me to
see them off for Africa.</p>

<p>While we were holding a few meetings in Philadelphia
I felt directed to go on with them as far as London, so purchased
my ticket with theirs, taking steerage passage
across the ocean for the third time. Immediately after getting
my ticket there came upon me a wonderful outpouring
of the Spirit and an assurance that was unmistakable that
I was in divine order. When I told those young missionaries
I was going with them as far as London they told me
they had been praying that I might be led to do that very
thing. After a safe voyage we reached Southampton in
seven days.</p>

<p>One Sabbath afternoon in London when we were holding
an open-air meeting on the street, God opened the flood-gates
of Heaven, and I with others sang and preached under
the power of the Holy Spirit. A Christian came and
said, "Sister Wheaton, there is a preacher here who wants
to speak to you." I refused to go, as there were drunkards
and toughs on their knees under conviction of sin. I
thought he was a preacher who wanted to criticise my methods.
They called me again, and I went to see what was
wanted. I found a fine-looking, well-dressed man much
past middle age under awful conviction of sin. He was a
backslider, and had stopped in passing, being attracted by
a hymn I was singing&mdash;one his mother used to sing. Yet
he was unwilling to yield himself to God. Some of those
in the company had talked with him and begged him to
kneel. At last his stubborn will was broken, and he knelt
there on that London street and confessed his sins to God.
When he arose from his knees he said he had been on his
way with a dagger then in his coat sleeve, to commit suicide,
but was attracted by that song his mother used to sing, and
could go no further. Thus by the power of the Holy Ghost
that Presiding Elder was saved on the streets through faithful,
honest trust in God, where the preacher and the drunkard
knelt side by side in the dust. I hope to meet them in
Heaven, and trust that all found peace with God. The
word says, "Go out in the streets and lanes of the city, and
in the hedges and highways." "Jesus came to seek and to
save that which was lost," not the righteous but sinners.
He came to save. How often people are waiting for Christians,
who profess to have salvation, to speak to them, and
how glad they are to receive the message if delivered in love.</p>

<p>I was located for a time at Woolwich, near the London
Arsenal. There were stationed thousands of soldiers and
they were often found in the public houses under the influence
of drink. I would plead with them to quit sinning,
turn to God, and seek salvation. Often tears were shed, and
resolves made to serve the Lord. There are many incidents
of souls being saved on the streets, in the slums and public
houses, but space forbids my going into details, but suffice
it to say that I have been given many proofs of God's love
and mercy from among the thousands who have heard the
gospel in those far-off lands, as well as in our home land.
Then let us encourage our missionaries everywhere to press
on until the Master says, "It is enough, come up higher."</p>

<p>I was much pained, while in England, to see so many
young women there, as in Scotland, selling beer and other
strong drink to customers in the public houses; beautiful
girls selling their souls to the tempter to be lost forever unless
in some way rescued before it is too late.</p>

<p>During this second visit to Europe I was often stopped
on the street and asked to sing to the people, which I frequently
did, regardless of remarks or criticisms, and the
Lord blessed my singing to the good of many souls. While
in London, night after night I would sing and preach the
gospel to people who longed for salvation, but knew not
how to get saved. How often we neglect an opportunity to
do good. Years after some of our missionaries returning
from Africa, passing through London, heard the people calling
to them, "Where is that old lady who sang for us?" So
we labor not in vain. In due season we shall reap if we faint
not.</p>

<p>After spending several weeks in England (most of the
time in London) I saw that precious band of young missionaries
take the steamer for Africa. The next day I embarked
for home at Southampton. Soon after starting we
sighted the vessel on which they sailed and I could distinguish
some of them waving their handkerchiefs in farewell.
One of them died in Africa ten months later. By and by
we shall meet again in the Kingdom of heaven, each one, I
trust, bringing with us sheaves to lay at Jesus' feet.</p>

<p>During the return voyage the sea was stormy at times,
yet the voyage was made safely, and on Sabbath morning,
the day after my arrival in New York, I went to the Tombs
prison to hold services. I was very tired, and after the
services I was so faint I prayed for the Lord to open the
way for me to have some refreshments, as I was to preach
in the afternoon at a Rescue Mission. There were many
elegantly dressed lady visitors at that meeting, but they all
passed out and left me alone, when a young, humble-looking
man came to me and said, "We are very poor, and are able
to afford but one meal a day, and not a full meal at that, but
it would be such a blessing to my wife and myself if you
would come and share it with us." My heart was touched
that this stranger should offer to share the little they had,
when others never thought of my needs. I did not go with
him, although I thanked him; it was so far to his home, but
God will reward him. For Jesus said, "I was a stranger
and ye took me in, hungry and ye fed me; I was in prison
and ye came unto me, sick and ye visited me."</p>

<h3>Travel and Toil.</h3>


<h4>TWO NIGHTS'S SERVICE.</h4>

<p>At one time when suffering from nervous prostration I
was lovingly cared for for some weeks in the home of dear
brother H. L. Hastings, of Boston. One night while there
I said to him: "I must go to the city tonight." He replied:
"Sister Wheaton, have you prayed about it?" I said, "Yes."
He answered, "Go and pray again." I did so and returned
to his office, saying, "I must go to the city tonight." They
were having watchnight service in the city. Again he replied:
"The night is very cold and you are sick. Go and
pray and find out the mind of God." Again I went to my
room to inquire diligently of the Lord and was sure that
the call of the Spirit was that I should go. Again I returned
to his office and told him I must go to the city that
night. Once more he replied: "Sister Wheaton, go and
pray." As I wept before the Lord He showed me the city
given up to idolatry and sin and again I went to Brother
Hastings' office and said: "I must go to the city." He
dropped his pen and hurriedly said: "Wife and I will go
with you." It was one of the coldest nights Boston had
known for years, but from one saloon to another the Lord
led us and from one watchnight meeting to another until
near midnight we entered a Mission hall. A fine-looking,
well-dressed young man from the platform hurried down
and said to me: "Mother, I am so glad to see you. Come
on the platform and speak to the people." I looked at the
man and he said: "Don't you know me, mother?" When
I said "No," he answered: "Don't you know your boy?"
I looked at him&mdash;so beautiful in the service of God&mdash;and
then he said: "I was in prison and you came and prayed
and sang for me. I was in the hospital, and got saved
there, and God is still blessing your boy." Reader, did it
pay? Yes, that night my heart rejoiced in my Savior for
all He had done for me and for my "children" in prison
walls. For seventeen years now this man has been a blessing
in helping to save others.</p>

<p>Another watchnight I spent in St. Louis, Missouri. Feeling
weary, I was about to retire for the night, when the
Lord showed me to go on the street and do service for Him.
So, doubting not, I pressed out for a cold night's work in
the slums. The sister who entertained me went with me
to the places of sin and also to six different watch-meetings,
at which we witnessed for the Master, leaving the results
with the Lord, who said: "And the books were opened,
and another book was opened, which is the book of life;
and the dead were judged out of those things which were
written in the books, according to their works."</p>


<h4>ONE WEEK'S WORK.</h4>

<p>A few years since, on arriving in Omaha after returning
from the East, I telephoned the jailer at the county jail:
"Can I have a meeting?" "Yes," came the reply. There
were a good many prisoners and we had a good service.
Sister Kelley, of Tabor, Iowa, was with me. Our singing
seemed much appreciated. Went from there to the city jail.
Held services there, and in the evening in a Rescue Mission.</p>

<p>At midnight we boarded the train for Deer Lodge, Montana.
En route our train stopped for a couple of hours at
Ogden, Utah, and while there we visited the Florence Crittenton
Rescue Home&mdash;where we were warmly welcomed by
both the matron and the girls and had a blessed service. God
bless them all!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Deer" id="Deer"></a>
<img src="images/ill-p397.jpg" width="450" height="247" alt="PRISON AT DEER LODGE, MONT." title="PRISON AT DEER LODGE, MONT." />
<span class="caption">PRISON AT DEER LODGE, MONT.</span>
</div>

<p>We arrived at the State prison at Deer Lodge on Saturday,
and had the privilege of preaching to the many prisoners
the following day. God blessed me in speaking, both to
the men and women. We sang many old-time hymns and
some new ones. Took each prisoner by the hand as they
passed out, visited the sick prisoners and went to two
churches that night, and visited the women prisoners on
Monday morning, and had real victory in prayer for them.
Then bidding goodbye to all we left for the prison at Boise
City, Idaho, where we arrived Tuesday. Telephoned the
warden asking permission to hold service at the prison.
The privilege was granted and a team was sent for us. We
found a large number of prisoners and the officials kind,
and had a good service of an hour. Visited the poor, condemned
men in their cells, prayed and wept with them, and
commended them to the great loving God who said:
"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as
snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
wool." After seeing the sick we left the prison; but my
heart was greatly drawn out for those men under death
sentence. I felt that one of them (a foreigner) was innocent.
I was almost overcome with sorrow. They were my
"children" and I never would see them again in this world,
and yet I was powerless to help them!</p>

<p>From Boise City we went to Salt Lake City. When we
arrived at the penitentiary there and mentioned our desire
to hold a service the warden's kind wife said: "The warden
is in the city and they are under contract and must get
their work done immediately&mdash;but you lie down and rest&mdash;you
are worn out" (and I was). So I slept until I heard
her tender voice, saying, "Mrs. Wheaton, lunch is ready
and the warden says he will give you forty minutes after
dinner in the chapel with the men." I was so glad and said:
"This is all through your kindness and God will reward
you." I found the men seated, waiting for me, in the chapel
and thankfully I improved that opportunity, knowing that
eternity would reveal the results of that service. I was permitted
to see the two men under death sentence and sing
and pray with them, and tell them of a Savior "mighty to
save and strong to deliver;" then with sad heart I left them&mdash;never
to meet them again till the trumpet should sound.
Precious in God's sight were those poor, forsaken, criminals!
And, reader, as I write these lines down in the slums
of Chicago, I see opposite me the saloon open day and night
luring men and women inside, fitting them also for the
prison and perhaps for the scaffold!</p>

<p>Leaving the prison at Salt Lake, we hurried to the county
jail, held services in two departments, and had a good
time with the prisoners; then left for the city jail. Did
what work we could there in the Lord's name and hurried
to the depot, only stopping on the way to get a little lunch
for the long journey before us. Weary and faint we
reached the train just as it was leaving. Too weak to go
further I got in the first car, which proved to be a dining
car. I said: "The boys will allow me to sit here awhile,"
and I heard a voice saying: "Come in, mother, sit down.
You are welcome in my car and you must have something
to eat. You look tired and hungry"&mdash;and wasn't I? And
when I told him of my friend in another car he had me
bring her also and gave us both a good supper, and was I
not thankful to God for that kind welcome from the dining
car conductor, who knew me? Surely God will reward
him. I hope to meet and know him in that land where we
shall never get weary and hungry.</p>

<p>We arrived at Rawlins, Wyoming, at nine the next morning.
We hurried to the prison. It was Decoration Day
and most of the guards were off for a holiday&mdash;the men
being locked in their cells. The warden kindly said to us:
"I wish I could let you talk to the men, but my officers are
gone and there is no one to guard them, and I am compelled
to remain at the office to see after business." I was
sure God had sent us, and said: "Will you permit us to see
the men in their cells?" After much deliberation he said:
"I'll tell you what I will do, I'll turn the men loose in the dining
room if you think you can control them, and let you have
an hour to talk to them." I said, "Surely I can manage
those men&mdash;why, they are my children, sir," and so down
the men came from their cells and O such a meeting! I
was at home and my "boys" were on their honor and I
talked to them as a mother and we sang together hymns
that they knew, and bless God He was guarding the men,
and I had nothing to do with the matter only to obey Him
and tell them the old, old story of the redeeming love of a
Savior who died to save us from our sins and give to us
eternal life. As I grasped each one by the hand at parting,
I found the men quiet and peaceable, humbly begging me
to come again. Then I saw the heavy iron doors close between
us and knew I would probably never see them together
again as we were there, but looked forward to the
great day in which, if he would, each man could have a part
in crowning Jesus Lord of lords and King of kings.</p>

<p>After having dinner with the few officers present in their
own dining room we hurried to the jail. There we were
permitted to preach the gospel to the prisoners and they
received us gladly. As I left the jailer expressed his appreciation
of the visit, saying it was so good of us to come
to help the prisoners&mdash;especially the girls.</p>

<p>Arriving at Lincoln, Nebraska, we attended the evening
service of the National Campmeeting then in progress there
and the next morning went to the prison. The warden
kindly granted us the privilege of a gospel service with the
prisoners. After holding this service and visiting the sick
in the hospital we returned to the camp ground. Reached
there during a testimony service just in time to be invited
by the leader to sing a certain hymn. Instantly I was
on my feet and soon on the platform saying, "Yes, I will
sing, but first I must sing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The toils of the road will seem nothing</span>
<span class="i0">When we get to the end of the way."</span>
</div>

<p>And shouts of praise went up to God all over that ground,
for He especially anointed me to sing that hymn. I felt
every word of it, for though weary and tired from the
journey, I knew God had been with me and had given victory
all along the way.</p>

<p>In this brief sketch I have failed to mention some services
held in missions and also special services on all the trains
on which we traveled&mdash;perhaps bringing to some their last
warning.</p>

<p>One night during this week's journey a crowd of drunken
men boarded the train. They were so abusive to me that
I went outside the car door. When I went in the next car
I found the same kind dining car conductor I have before
mentioned. At his inquiry as to what was the matter I just
knelt and prayed and then told him how the drunken men
had acted. He said: "Come with me. This won't do. I
will see that you and your sister have a sleeper." He
went with me into the other car, and when the men saw the
man in uniform with me they tried to be very polite. They
were under the influence of drink and in a sense not responsible
for their actions. Who is responsible? The saloon,
the brewery, the devil who uses these things to make
men and women oftentimes more like fiends than creatures
made in the image and likeness of God, and all who fail to
use their influence against the liquor traffic are responsible.</p>

<p>From Lincoln we went to Omaha where we parted feeling
that the days had been spent for God and souls&mdash;the
dear sister to return to her work in the missionary training
home at Tabor, Iowa, I to hurry on to Chicago, taking
with me one of the sisters I met for the first time in the
slum mission work in Omaha a week previous.</p>

<p>So we turned over that week's work to the Lord of the
harvest, who will see that the seed scattered along life's
pathway shall bring forth fruit unto eternal life.</p>


<h4>A PROFITABLE TRIP.</h4>

<p>Walking along the street in Chicago on my way to the
Cook County Jail to see the "car-barn bandits" and one or
two others under death sentence, I was impressed that I
must go to some State Prison for Easter, only two days
off. I stopped and prayed, inquiring of the Lord where he
would have me go.</p>

<p>I had been east and just arrived in the city, weary and
worn, but I knew the voice of God was saying, "Go!"
but where and by what route I knew not. I stood still until
the Lord made it plain to go westward&mdash;to what place
I need not know, but to go to the railroad office and get
transportation. When I entered the office the kind official
said, "What can I do for you, Mother?" At first I answered,
"I hardly know what to ask for, as it is not yet
plain to me just where to go;" but a little later I said to him,
"I must go to Canon City, Colorado." "All right," he
said, and gave me transportation. It was then too late, under
ordinary circumstances, to visit the jail, but I felt that
I must see those condemned boys before their execution,
and I prayed that God would open my way and incline the
heart of the jailer, Mr. Whitman, to grant me the desired
opportunity. To my surprise I found Mr. Whitman on
the street car. I told him that I must leave the city at
once for western prisons and asked if he would kindly give
me permission to see the condemned men who were in his
charge, before I left, as I could not return before the day
set for execution. He was very kind and answered, "Yes,
I will send an officer with you to see the boys."</p>

<p>That hour will never be forgotten. Instead of tough,
rough looking men I found "mother's boys" in the prime of
their young manhood. Kindly, tenderly I talked to them,
thinking to myself, what if it were my boy, now safe in
Heaven? O sisters, it seemed to me my heart would break
as I placed my hands on their heads, so soon to be cold in
death and commended them to the God who sent His only
begotten Son, who, when on the cross, said, "Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do!" I left the
prison, praying that my message might not be in vain.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Chicago over the Santa Fe railroad on my
way west, I prayed earnestly for direction as to what prison
I should visit on Easter Sunday and was impressed to
stop at Joliet. The warden, Mr. Murphy, and his estimable
wife were kind and hospitable, as they always are, and the
chaplain was willing that I should have a part in the services
on the Sabbath. God was present in power in all the
services. Many of the prisoners partook of the communion
with their teachers and chaplain.</p>

<p>The Lord alone can reward the warden's wife for her
special kindness to me at this time, for I was taken sick
from overwork and detained over Monday. I then left
at midnight for Topeka, Kansas, where the Lord sent me
to the railroad shops to hold services at the noon hour
while the men were resting after lunch. Our meeting with
them was signally owned and blessed of God. At its close
I shook hands with each of those hundreds of men and
then went to the jail where the Lord again graciously met
with us.</p>

<p>Reaching Pueblo on our way to Canon City we telephoned
the jailer&mdash;also the matron of the Rescue Home&mdash;and obtained
permission to hold services at each on our return.</p>

<p>At Canon City the warden and his wife gave us a most
kind and courteous welcome and he granted the privilege
of holding services for the prisoners in the chapel, also at
the hospital and cell houses. I visited their night school.
It was very interesting to see so many teaching other prisoners.
The most important part of my work at Canon City,
however, was seeing three young men who were under
death sentence. While I prayed day after day for them,
they came to see their true condition before God and, I
believe, gave evidence of true repentance. I hope to meet
them all in Heaven.</p>

<p>But oh, what a sad sight to see those young men in the
prime of life, sentenced to die; and all on account of strong
drink.</p>

<p>How pitifully they talked of home and mother and innocent
childhood days! Their hearts were melted and broken.
Poor boys! far away from home and friends, with few to
care and many to cry out, "They deserve to die"&mdash;never
seeing the cause, the rum traffic. Why not stop that which
sends our young men by the thousands to a drunkard's or
a criminal's grave? When I bade these young men farewell
they were cheerful and confident that the Lord had
forgiven them.</p>

<p>Arriving at Pueblo on the return trip, we went to the
Rescue Home where we received a kind welcome; also
held services in the prison there. I forgot to mention services
held in jail and almshouse while in Canon City.</p>

<p>At Denver we found friends who received us kindly. We
held services in their mission church. Also held service
in the large jail in which I conducted the first meeting ever
held after it was built.</p>

<p>Leaving Denver we went to Lincoln, Neb., to hold services
in the State Prison on the Sabbath. Found there my
friends, Warden Beemer and wife, who have always been
so kind to me. Our meetings were crowned with success
and victory. Also did personal work, which is important.</p>

<p>While I was there, two new prisoners were brought in.</p>

<p>Left Monday for Omaha and went at once to the County
Jail and held meetings in the three different wards. God
blessed His own word to the good of souls! There, as elsewhere,
I met some who knew me. From Omaha I went
to Chicago, where I spent some time in missions, etc.</p>


<h4>SIX WEEKS' SERVICE.</h4>

<p>About July 1, 1904, I spent some time in St. Louis, visiting
the slums, dives and saloons, faithfully warning the
multitudes I found in sin. Left there for Jefferson City,
where I held services in the State Prison. We give here
the following extract written by the sister who accompanied
me on this trip:</p>


<h5>MY TRIP TO JEFFERSON CITY.</h5>

<blockquote><p>I was glad to have the opportunity of visiting the prison in Jefferson
City with Mother Wheaton, who is one of our oldest and most
successful prison workers.</p>

<p>We were off early Saturday morning, July 2, and arrived there at
2:30 o'clock. We had dinner, then went to the prison. The guard
first took us to see the women. They were all seated at machines,
sewing very rapidly, and I was told I was not allowed to speak to
them. My heart ached and I could not keep back the tears as I
looked on the precious girls I had labored with in the jail at St.
Louis, some seven or eight of them. At 6 o'clock we had a short
meeting with a hundred and fifty shop girls. Many of them were
moved to tears, and we believe good was accomplished. Sunday
morning we had a good meeting in the jail, then at 2:30 went back
to the prison and gave the gospel to twenty-two hundred convicts. It
was a blessed time. I never saw such attention, and while Mother
Wheaton spoke and we sang "He Pardoned a Rebel Like Me," I
saw some of them wiping the tears from their eyes. These men are
not all hard-hearted. As I looked at them and heard almost all of
them join in with us and sing "We'll Never Say Good-Bye in
Heaven," somehow I lost sight of the stripes and prison walls and
bars, and thought how precious they are in God's sight, and I believe
many will be gathered to praise Him, who was pierced for us
all. After the meeting a young man asked permission to speak to us;
his face shone with the glory of God as he told how he had been
there five years, and had been saved two years and a half and called
to preach the gospel. He proved his earnestness when Mother
Wheaton asked if he would let her try to get him pardoned, and he
answered: "No, I am guilty, and I not only feel it my duty to
serve my time, but will make restitution as soon as I am out. Then
I shall give myself to the Lord's work."</p></blockquote>

<p>Returning to St. Louis I next went to Denver, Colo., to
see Governor Peabody in behalf of the three young men
who were awaiting execution. The governor was very
kind and willing to do what was right. In Denver I had
services in the jail, also spoke at two meetings and preached
at night at a mission church. Next visited the State Reformatory
for Young Men at Buena Vista, Colo. Most of
the officers and all the boys attended the services. Leaving
here in the evening arrived at Salt Lake City next day
about noon. I hurried to the State Prison and was surprised
to find a new warden, as the former warden had
died. It being a working day had only a short service with
the prisoners, but it was blessed of the Lord. Then visited
the county and city jails, holding three services. Leaving
here, traveling all night, arrived the next evening at Canon
City, Colo. Hurrying to the State Prison we were kindly
received and permitted to hold services in the cell houses
till 9 o'clock. The warden informed me that one of the
boys under death sentence had gone insane just the day
before and could not be seen. One of the other boys under
sentence of death said the last thing that this one had done
was to write me a letter, of which I here insert an extract:</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
<span class="smcap">Canon City, Colo.</span>, July 12, 1904.</p>

<p>Dear Mother Wheaton:&mdash;
</p>

<p>It is with pleasure that I answer your welcome letter, which was
appreciated. We are waiting patiently to know the verdict. If it is
God's will that I must be taken out of this world, I will go, but it is
very hard, as I have done nothing worthy of death, but they look at
it different, I suppose. Whatever got me into such a scrape I cannot
tell. I have always worked hard for my living.</p>

<p>Dear Mother, I have done as you requested. I commenced to
read the New Testament on the 28th of June and completed it on the
10th of July. I never forget to read the Holy Bible and to pray.</p>

<p>You wished to know if we boys had any work to do. It is beyond
the warden's power to let us work under the circumstances,
though he is very kind to us; also the other officials. We are allowed
all the reading matter we can use and have exercise each day.</p>

<p>Dear Mother Wheaton, I hope that we will meet again on earth.
If not, I pray we may in heaven. And may our Heavenly Father
protect you in the work of His cause. I ever remain your son in
Jesus.</p>

<p class="signature">
C&mdash;&mdash;. P&mdash;&mdash;.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Leaving Canon City we hurry on, visiting next the State
Prison at Lincoln, Neb. There we found another poor
man under death sentence, who gladly listened while I
taught him the way of life. Oh, the joy that filled my soul
as I told him of the Savior who would pardon all his
sins. After seeing the other prisoners who are always glad
to see true friends, we hastened on to Omaha, Neb. Here
I held four services in jails and Rescue Homes. When
leaving Omaha as I was singing on the train I found some
ladies crying; one of them, grasping my hand, said, "When
you sang 'My Name in Mother's Prayer,' I thought how
often my mother, who is in the baggage coach, has prayed
for me, and I will never hear her pray again." I soon
changed cars and bade farewell to the sorrowing friends,
hoping to meet them with that mother where there is no
death nor tears.</p>

<span class="caption">CRIMINAL INSANE HOSPITAL, CHESTER, ILL.</span>
</div>

<p>Resting for a short time at Tabor, Iowa, I then went to
St. Louis and on to Chester, Ill., to hold services in the
State Prison. We were here four days and held services
in the State Prison, jail, and Criminal Insane Hospital,
where there are more than one hundred inmates.</p>

<p>Once while holding services here one young man was
saved and his mind restored. He has now been preaching
the Gospel for several years. "Is there anything too hard
for the Lord?"</p>

<p>We next visited Gatesville, Texas, where is located the
Reform School for Boys. Obtained permission to see the
boys and it fortunately being a holiday I was allowed to
hold services in both the white and colored wards. The
way the boys seemed to enjoy the meetings and to hear
them sing was encouraging. Leaving for Huntsville, Tex.,
we went to different towns, holding services in jails and
on the streets till Saturday, when we arrived at Rusk,
Texas, and were met by the chaplain, Mr. Dawson, who
treated us kindly and gave me the privilege of holding meetings
on the Sabbath. Had a very impressive service in the
afternoon in the prison yard where we gathered round a
coffin to pay the last tribute of love to a departed prisoner,
after which we held a meeting in the prison hospital.</p>

<p>We next visited the State Prison at Huntsville, Texas,
where we were kindly given the entire time in chapel service,
and also the privilege of holding services in the different
wards of the hospital. Here all seemed encouraged
and were much effected, the tears flowing freely upon many
of the pale faces.</p>

<p>I received upon this visit the following kind tribute from
the Assistant Superintendent and Prison Physician:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was present at the services conducted by Mother Wheaton at
the Huntsville Penitentiary, on August 7, 1904, and noticed with
much satisfaction that her remarks and singing were very much
appreciated by the men, and many of them seemed very much
affected, and I think that the service will be conducive to much good
hereafter.</p>

<p>Mother Wheaton visited the Huntsville Prison Hospital this
morning and I think her words of cheer and advice given to the sick
will be the means of doing great good.</p>

<p>At the Woman's Prison, also located at Huntsville, we
found over one hundred women prisoners all working on
the farm except the few white women. We held meetings
with these women in the afternoon and evening for three
days, which were blessed of the Lord. While I wept with
them I thought of the Scripture, "Weep with those that
weep." Jesus loved me and saved me and has put a real
love in my heart for those souls.</p>

<p>The kind chaplain took us with his invalid wife on Sabbath
afternoon to visit the consumptives' prison a few
miles from Huntsville. Here the prisoners sick with consumption
are located on a farm. Had a blessed meeting
with them. The weather being so warm my health would
not permit me to visit the several stockades in this state,
where are mines, sugar refineries or farms.</p>

<p>Returning to St. Louis, Mo., worn and weary, we were
kindly entertained at the Berachah Home for Girls. Again
we visited the slums, missions, and dives. The sin during
these fairs and expositions is awful in the extreme. I have
no time or desire to go to see the sights, but am after souls.</p>

<p>Next we went to Leavenworth, Kan.; was kindly given
the hour for service Sabbath morning, at the State Prison
at Lansing, also a service with the women prisoners. Also
visited the Soldiers' Home, and by the kindness of the superintendent
was permitted to speak to the aged soldiers.</p>

<p>We then found a welcome in the home of Sister Two-good,
who accompanied us to the Old Ladies' Rest, where
I held services in their lovely new home. In the evening
till after 10 o'clock we were speaking to crowds on the
streets who seldom attend church.</p>

<p>Returning then to Tabor, Iowa, weary with this six weeks'
constant service, I was for some weeks unable to travel.
One night when as I thought, near death, I cried mightily
to God and he heard my cry, touched my body and healed
me. After a few weeks' rest, yet scarcely able to travel,
I started again on my mission seeking the lost.</p>


<h4>RECENT WORK.</h4>

<p>During these weeks of waiting the responsibility of finishing
this book then in preparation, and getting it to its
readers bore heavily upon me. Knowing that I could not
attend to this and continue my work, I was in answer to
prayer assured that I should be relieved of the burden of
managing the publication, sale, and distribution of the book.
After much prayer about the matter I was relieved of this
burden in a very satisfactory manner, Bro. C. M. Kelley
taking the management of the same for the Lord.</p>

<p>While yet weak in body, receiving indication from the
Lord that I should be about His work, I went on my way,
taking with me a young sister from the Training Home,
who expects to devote her life's service as a missionary in
Japan, the Holy Spirit assuring her also that she should
accompany me on this trip. I leave it for her to write the
account of the following few weeks' work.</p>

<p>I was blessed with an opportunity to travel a few weeks
with "Mother Wheaton" in her work in prisons, etc. Leaving
the Home at Tabor, Ia., September 28, 1904, we first
visited the jail at Council Bluffs, where Mother Wheaton
held a Gospel service. A number of the prisoners asked for
prayer. We next went to Chicago, where on the Lord's
day we visited the county jail, where were about 540 men
and a few women. After their chapel service we were
given access to the corridors where we could talk to all.
We also took part in several services at the Beulah Rescue
Homes, some missions, etc.</p>

<p>On October 15, we were at Ft. Madison, Iowa, and visited
the several wards in the State Prison and sang and
prayed with the sick. On Sabbath Mother Wheaton conducted
services in the chapel, also at the county jail and
the Santa Fe Railroad Hospital.</p>

<p>We next attended the National Prison Congress in session
at Quincy, Ill. We here had opportunities to witness
for God. Monday evening, by invitation, Mother Wheaton
spoke at the Soldiers' Home, where God poured out His
Spirit and melted the hearts of some who were steeped in
sin. The following morning we visited the hospital and
prayed and sang with the sick who seemed very glad to hear
the good old-time hymns. We then went to the jail where
one woman accused of murder was especially touched and
broken up, seeing there was someone who loved and cared
for her. It is the love of Jesus that brings sinners to repentance.
The day following, October 18, we held service
at the Chaddick Boys' School which is under Deaconess'
management. Here Mother Wheaton spoke to ninety young
boys.</p>

<p>Provision was made for those in attendance at the
Prison Congress to take an excursion down the river, but
instead of going with this company we went to the House
of Correction, where the superintendent seemed glad to
have Mother Wheaton speak to the prisoners, both men and
women, even calling in the men from their work.</p>

</div>

<p>October 19 we returned to Chicago. The next morning
we took the train for Marquette, Mich., on the shore of
Lake Superior, where is located a State Prison. Upon our
arrival there we went to the chaplain, who kindly gave permission
to conduct the next Sabbath morning services. We
then visited the poor house, where we sang and prayed
with those who were lonely and sad, and knew nothing about
Jesus. On Saturday it was stormy, but Mother Wheaton
held a service at the county jail, which God blessed.
The Lord's day, October 23, was a day long to be remembered
by many of the prisoners, who that day received a
ray of hope. The Spirit of God so anointed Mother Wheaton
to speak that the prisoners seemed to be held spellbound,
with hearts open to receive every word and song.
In the afternoon we were given the privilege of talking
and singing in the corridors and speaking to the prisoners
in their cells. It was told us that these were the worst
men in the state, twenty-four of whom were serving life
sentences. But God touched their hearts, many being moved
to tears. We left some of them with new hopes, calling upon
God for help and asking us to pray for them. Mother
Wheaton said they were all her own dear boys.</p>

<p>Journeying eastward we held services in Indianapolis,
Ind., also in the State Prison at Columbus, Ohio, and in
the Woman's Prison at Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Sabbath
morning, November 5, Mother Wheaton spoke in the corridors
of the State Prison in Philadelphia, and in the afternoon
at the House of Correction. Here the Lord wonderfully
spoke to the hearts of many young girls. Many men
were moved upon by the Spirit. The officers looked on
with amazement to see how attentive they all seemed to be.</p>

<p>At Trenton, N. J., at the county jail God moved upon
hearts and many asked for prayer.</p>

<p>At the State Prison at Trenton, N. J., we received a warm
welcome and Mother Wheaton was given opportunity to
preach on the following Lord's day in the chapel. We visited
the woman's department and held a service with them,
all stopping their work and giving attention. God melted
the hearts of those women who have gone away from Him.
Jesus' blood is able to cleanse from every stain.</p>

<p>After a few busy days of service in New York city we returned
to Trenton, for the service in the prison on the Sabbath.
We then returned westward by way of Baltimore and
Washington, D. C. We next held a service in the prison at
Canton, Ohio, and then went to Mansfield to the State Reformatory,
where were nearly a thousand young men. Here
God wonderfully answered prayer. The superintendent and
chaplain were very kind, supplying us with such things as
we had need of. We arrived in Chicago November 20.
Leaving there we went by way of Marion and Anamosa,
Iowa, where we held services. We arrived at Tabor on
Thanksgiving day, November 24, which was truly a thanksgiving
day with us, for the wonderful way in which God
had answered prayer and brought us safely through so
many dangers and given us such glorious victories in His
blessed service.</p>

<p>Leaving Tabor December 15, taking with me Sister Taylor,
who for several years has accompanied me at intervals
in my work, silently praying for me while I preach, sing or
pray, I started for San Francisco, California, via Santa Fe,
New Mexico. We stopped at Hutchison, Kansas, where
is located the State Industrial Reform School for Young
Men. We net the wife of the superintendent of that institution,
who kindly took us to the school. I had held service
here with prisoners who were working on the buildings
when they were being erected.</p>

<p>The officers arranged for a service in the chapel though
it was a week day and just before Christmas. The meeting
was owned and blessed of the Lord. Also at Santa Fe
we were kindly entertained by the wife of the superintendent
of the prison, and the officers gave us a service in the
chapel and the prisoners, both men and women, privilege to
attend. About half the prisoners being Mexicans I had to
speak to them by the aid of an interpreter. This service was
also signally owned of the Lord. We also held special service
with the women.</p>

<p>We then left for the coast and had several services en
route with the passengers and railroad men; also with a
hundred soldiers who were going to their winter quarters.
I had warned the soldiers about drinking. It seemed so
sad to see them drinking and gambling. Poor boys, there
seems to be no way of restraining them from strong drink
so long as they can get it. Some trouble arose between
them and other parties and one of the soldiers was badly cut
in the throat. In a town in California I held services in a
number of saloons and dance halls. It was Christmas day
and I never saw more drinking among the people and I
never want to witness such again. Why will people indulge
in strong drink, when God has said no drunkard shall inherit
the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<p>We arrived in San Francisco and found many open doors
to preach the Gospel. I visited the State Prison at San
Quentin. The chaplain was very kind, giving me privileges
of the chapel services and a special service with the women.
This prison was first opened to me in 1898 in direct answer
to prayer. I also held services in the city prisons.</p>

<p>We also visited the Federal Prison on Alcatraz Island,
where we held three services with the manifest blessing of
God upon our souls. The kindness of the officers and the
appreciation shown by the prisoners there will not be forgotten.
I am sure God will reward those who are kind to
His children, and who assist His workers in any way.</p>

<p>During the first four months of 1905 we found much to
do for the Lord in Los Angeles, San Pedro and other
places in California, one of these of special importance was
the Reformatory at Whittier.</p>

<span class="caption">INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, WHITTIER, CAL.</span>
</div>

<p>Early in May, having received a letter from one of the
boys in Colorado under sentence of death, I hastened to
that state to see the new governor in their behalf. I was
kindly received and heard by the governor, but as the
Board of Pardons was to soon meet he declined to make
any promises. Tarrying several days for the board to meet,
I met with them and made a plea for the lives of the boys
who had, under the influence of drink, accidentally, as they
claimed, taken life.</p>

<p>They received a reprieve for four weeks, but the two
who were adjudged sane were executed June 16. I give
elsewhere an extract from a letter received from the
mother of one of these boys shortly afterward. Also an
extract from a paper concerning the mother of the other.</p>

<p>After returning to Iowa and remaining but a few days,
accompanied by a young sister from the Home, I returned to
Colorado, visiting, en route, the jail at Council Bluffs,
Iowa, and the State Prison at Lincoln, Nebraska, where
we held service on the Lord's day. We then proceeded to
Canon City to visit the condemned boys, and held services
in the corridors of the prison till late at night. We next
went to Buena Vista, where we held service in the State
Reform School for Boys, and in the jail. On our return
east we stopped at a camp meeting at Newton, Kansas,
where the Lord blessed in the jail and in the work on the
street. Going next to Chicago we held service in the
county jail with about four hundred men. We next visited
the prison at Joliet, Illinois, but only had service in the
prison hospital and proceeded to Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
for services on the Lord's day; then returned to Tabor,
stopping in Omaha and holding a service in the county
jail.</p>

<p>Taking with me the young sister whom I have elsewhere
mentioned as having first known as an orphan girl, now
starting for India, I spent a day at Plattsmouth, Nebraska,
where we talked and sang in a tent meeting, on the street,
and in the jail. The time set for the missionary band to sail
being near, we hurried westward, stopping at but a few
places till we reached Sacramento, where we had work to
do for souls in the prison and other places. We next visited
the prison at Salem, Oregon, and also made a short
stay at Portland. Upon reaching Tacoma we learned that
the time of sailing had been put off a week, so we improved
the time seeking out the lost in mission work, etc.</p>

<p>The company of nine missionaries, including one child,
boarded the steamship "Minnesota," and by the kindness
of the general superintendent of the company we were permitted
to spend a night before sailing on board the vessel
with them, which was a time very much enjoyed in the
Lord. The parting was not one of sadness, but of sweet
peace and calmness. As we looked into the faces of the
dear ones as they were being borne away we rejoiced that
God has a few whom He can trust to carry the precious
Gospel to the heathen. As the vessel bearing its precious
burden sailed from our view, the little company of anxious
watchers kneeled down and committed the dear ones to
Him who has said that His children are as dear to Him
as the apple of His eye. We were afterward delighted to
hear that they had a most delightful voyage, reaching Yokohama,
Japan, in eighteen days, just in time to escape a
very disastrous storm on the sea.</p>

<p>As a sister had accompanied some of the missionaries to
the coast and was to return with me, assisting me in the
work, we turned our attention to the needs of the lost ones
about us. I will let this sister here give a brief sketch of
our return trip, on which we trust much good was done
for souls:</p>


<h4>RETURN FROM PACIFIC COAST.</h4>

<p>Mother Wheaton's companion to the coast, Sister Yarrett,
having sailed for India, it was my privilege to accompany
her from Seattle to Iowa. From the wharf, when we
had committed the company of dear missionaries to the
Lord, we went to the rooms of the Y. W. C. A. and held
religious service while the young ladies had lunch. About
two hundred young women lunch in these rooms daily. At
night Mother Wheaton spoke at the Life Boat Mission
with the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and many hearts
seemed touched.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we left Seattle on board the
S. S. Whatcom, en route to Victoria, British Columbia.
This was a most enjoyable trip to me. At Victoria we had
a very profitable service in the W. C. T. U. Rescue Home,
and the Lord especially blessed the visit and service. Later
we spent five days very profitably in Portland laboring in
the Exposition Camp Meeting, visiting the jails, saloons
and slums, preaching and singing the Gospel.</p>

<p>We next went to Boise, Idaho, where we held services in
the Soldiers' Home and in the State Prison. Service with
the women prisoners and prayer with the men under death
sentence were special features of our visit to this place.
We next spent a day in Rawlins, Wyoming, visiting the
state and county prisons, holding short but profitable services
in each. In the county jail here a raving maniac was
quieted by Mother Wheaton's singing.</p>

<p>Another night and day's travel across the plains and
beautiful country and we were in Omaha, Nebraska. Here
we spent several days, being entertained in the Tinley Rescue
Home. This indeed is a refuge for the fallen. Our
time here was well occupied in the jails, missions and
churches. Then we hurried on to Tabor. I to resume duties
in the school room, and Mother Wheaton, after a few
days' rest, to continue her pilgrimage seeking the wandering
and the lost ones of earth till she shall be called from
toil to her reward which shall surely be one worth gaining.</p>

<h4>ANOTHER TRIP.</h4>

<p>After attending Prison Congress at Lincoln, Neb., Oct.
21 to 26, I left for western prisons and other institutions.
Held services at Old Soldiers' Home, Grand Island, Nebraska,
the 27th, then went to Rawlings, Wyoming; held
services on Sunday at the prison chapel with all the prisoners,
then at the county jail. Had great liberty in both
prisons. Left at night for Salt Lake City, Utah. Found
open doors. Held services at state prison jail on Monday
afternoon; also in the county jail, two services. Left that
night for Ogden; held services in the county jail and at
Crittendon Rescue Home. Left for Deer Lodge, Montana,
where I was kindly received by the warden, Frank Conley,
who has ever proved one of the best of friends to me in
my work in prison&mdash;always arranging for services Sunday
or week day and entertaining myself and any one I brought
with me, and never letting me go away without something
to help defray expenses along the way. Sunday afternoon
at Butte City held two services at the county jail; took train
at night for Walla Walla, Washington and arrived there at
3:30 a. m., and went to Chaplain Lacornu's home. After
resting, prayer and breakfast, we went to the state prison,
where I held services with the twelve women prisoners;
then in the dining room, held services with the men&mdash;about
eight hundred prisoners. The Lord was present in
both services to own and bless and many were helped to a
better life and higher aims. Left there for county jail
where we had profitable service with men and women.</p>

<p>Left that night for Portland, Oregon. Was kindly entertained
by one who has been preaching the gospel for
nearly twenty years, who was convicted in prison while I
was preaching in the prison in Bismark, N. D., one night
after nine o'clock. He was converted and has done great
good in the work, both in prison and outside ever since.
Much of his success is due to his faithful Christian wife,
who has ever been his true friend and helpmeet.</p>

<p>Called on Mrs. Smith, a prison missionary, who for years
has done mission work in Salem and Walla Walla prisons.
Then left for Salem, Oregon, where I held services with
the prisoners in the jail on the Sabbath day, also with the
women prisoners on Saturday afternoon. Was kindly received
by the Superintendent of the prison and his family,
also by the Bible school in charge of Brother and Sister
Ryan, where I held services on Sunday night in the chapel
with students and citizens. Left Monday morning for the
South. Stopped in Sacramento, and went to the Rescue
Home and held services for the girls while I waited for
the train to Carson City, Nevada. Changed cars at Reno
and waiting for neither rest or food hurried on to Carson
City to see the Governor and the Attorney General about
prison work. Found four men under sentence of death. I
pleaded with the Governor for a commutation of sentence.
Governor Sparks asked me if I could meet with the Board
of Pardons and himself at 2 p. m., and gave me a letter to
the warden to allow me to see the condemned men and hold
services with them&mdash;also with all of the prisoners. The
Governor also arranged for me to go to the prison with one
of the officers. Found the poor men heart broken over
their condition, and really sorry for their sin. They had
all been drinking, and among the four of them they had
killed a young man, and all were doomed to die.</p>

<p>When I entered their prison with the death-watch I was
overcome with sorrow for the poor unfortunates who so
soon would be in eternity, and as I came in the door one
of the prisoners said, "O, it is Mother Wheaton." As I
clasped his hand he said, "Mother, I knew you twenty
years ago." I said, "Where?" and he said, "In San Francisco."
Reader, you may try to sympathize or criticize at
such a time, with them and me, but you never will know
what the suffering is until you have passed through this
ordeal of just standing alone with the good Lord and the
condemned, so soon to die that horrible death. You cannot
picture it, for death is awful to those not prepared to
die&mdash;filled with remorse of conscience and sorrow for the
deed done while under the influence of whiskey and possessed
with the devil, which the strong drink causes&mdash;and
then to have no hope in this world or the world to come,
and alone with their conscience, the death-watch, myself
and our God.</p>

<p>I knelt in prayer. First to ask wisdom of the blessed
Christ who never turned anyone away, and then, taking
each one by the hand through the iron bars, I was lost to
this world and its opinions and criticisms. I entered into
their heart-sorrow, and at once took hold on God for the
salvation of their immortal souls. Quietly, but with strong
faith in God and the atoning blood of Jesus our Saviour,
I believed for their salvation. Human sympathy will not
avail. It is the suffering and death of Christ which avails
in the face of death. And I believe, if Jacob prevailed
in prayer as a prince, it is our privilege to believe God
hears and answers prayer and saves to the uttermost the
vilest sinner who truly repents of his sins, and claims His
promises. "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they
shall be as wool." Isa. 1:18.</p>

<p>We wept and prayed together, and while I sang the good
old hymns our mothers knew and loved and sung for us in
childhood, we took hold on God by faith for their souls'
salvation, and I believe God heard and answered our prayers,
that fifteenth day of November, 1905, in that prison,
and that those men that day were forgiven their sins. I
know God's Word is sure, and I depend daily on the Bible
and its holy teachings, and accept His promise, and receive
the answer from God that His pardon is sure.</p>

<p>I told the men I had no hope for their lives to be spared&mdash;that
the Governor had not given me any encouragement
for them, but had invited me to meet with him and the
Board of Pardons at 2 p. m., and see what they would do
in the case. I pleaded with them to let go all hope of a life
sentence, and prepare to die, for there was only one more
day for them to live&mdash;that I had nothing to give them of
hope, only in the precious blood of Jesus&mdash;that their days
were numbered.</p>

<p>O, the human heart is susceptible to suffering, and my
suffering was intense for them. I was weak and weary,
having traveled two days and two nights without rest.
Yet I could not rest when there was so much at stake for
them. I abandoned myself to the Holy Ghost to guide me
in the service, and then as I took each hand, so soon to be
cold in death, I knew only God could save them. I shall
not forget the parting with those poor, unfortunate men,
all in the prime of life and strength of manhood. I will
meet them again soon in the presence of God.</p>

<p>I was so weak in body that the officer kindly assisted me
to the main prison, where I was to hold services with all of
the prisoners. It was high noon, and the warden and officers
urged me to take refreshments. I said, "No, I am
soon going to the judgment, and I want to go with a clear
conscience. How could I eat, when all these prisoners
need the gospel so much?" And they kindly gave me the
privilege of an hour's service. Then, after a hurried lunch,
which was both breakfast and dinner, the state carriage
was ready to take me to the Capitol to meet the Governor
and Board of Pardons. But there was no hope, the Board
refused to commute the sentence, and all four were executed
November 17, for the death of one young man. Soon
I must stand together at the judgment bar of God, with
those whose lives were taken, one by the four under the
influence of whiskey, which makes men and women crazy
and worse than brutes; licensed by the laws of our land&mdash;the
others by the men who, in their right minds, as executors
of the law, put to death the helpless victims who had
truly repented of their sins and promised to obey God and
the rules, and live good law-abiding citizens.</p>

<p>I want it understood that I believe in law and its enforcement.
I sympathize with both the murdered and the murderers.
I believe in obeying God and His laws and enforcing
discipline, and I assist the officers of the state to
maintain law and order, but I say, give deliverance from
the abominable saloon and all the evil that follows in its
wake. Give us judges, jurymen and officers, who, in every
sense try to banish and abolish the liquor traffic and the
dens of sin, and there will be no need of our state officers
having to take life which none can give.</p>

<p>Leaving the Capitol after the decision was made by the
Board of Pardons and Governor, I went to the hotel to
tell the two sisters of one of the condemned men that all
hope of their brother's life was gone, and that they must
prepare to face the awful sorrow of losing their brother.
That scene was O, so pitiful! The brother and these two
sisters were orphans. He was a good boy and supported
the two sisters after the parents had died, but he had fallen
into bad company who had led him astray. The sisters
were heart broken. It seemed as if they could not give up
that dear brother who had done so much for them. I
helped them on the train, and went with them as far as
Reno, Nevada, and we parted to meet again after all the
sorrow and mistakes of our lives are forgotten and forgiven.</p>

<p>After leaving them I held services for the Salvation
Army friends and on the street. Then left that night,
though very weary, for the east. After taking the train,
I could see in my mind those poor condemned men, waiting
the few last hours until the law should have its way.
Eternity alone will reveal all hearts and lives.</p>

<p>Arrived at Ogden, I went to the Crittendon Home, then
on to the State Industrial School for Boys and Young Men,
and had a service in all the cottages. Was with them two
evenings. They all seemed cheered by the old good songs
and the services. Saying "Good-bye" to all in their dining
room at their daylight breakfast hour, I left them for the
east.</p>

<p>I stopped at Columbus, Nebraska, a day, and at Omaha,
where many railroad friends and others met and greeted
me kindly. Then hurried on to Joliet, Illinois, State Prison,
where dear Mrs. Murphy, wife of the warden, gave me a
warm welcome to her lovely home in the state prison. Went
with the chaplain to visit the hospital and spoke with the
men at the Sabbath School hour, and then to the women's
prison, where I was given the privilege of addressing all
the female prisoners. Many were much affected, and shed
tears as I spoke or sang to them "My Name in Mother's
Prayer," "Is There Anyone Can Help Us" and "Old Time
Religion." Shook hands with most of the women, prayed
and sang for a sick girl in the prison hospital, and left for
the jail. Spoke there, then on to Chicago. After some
days in the city, busy for the Lord, I made a trip to Washington,
D. C., and returned before the close of the year,
and proceeded to the Pacific coast early in the new year.</p>

<p>O, how I praise the Lord for His grace and love, and
the strength and endurance He gives me to keep going to
carry His messages of love and good cheer to the lost ones
in low and in high pursuits of life.</p>

<p>Dear Reader: We must here close the account of our
travel and toil in the Master's vineyard, and we feel that it
will all soon be over, and the victory be won. When I shall
have finished my course I want to be able to say, like Paul
of old, that "I have fought a good fight." I want, too, to
know that the crown is laid up for me as one of those who
have been faithful and that love the appearing of my Savior.</p>

<p>Though but sixty-one years of age, the excessive toil,
the wearisome journeys, the heart-rending scenes and experiences
for more than one-third of my life, have told upon
my once strong body until I am now a physical wreck.
Only in the strength of Jehovah and leaning upon His everlasting
arm am I able to pursue the calling He has given
me. "But the toils of the road will seem nothing when we
get to the end of the way." You and I shall meet again,
on that great Judgment morning, and must give an account
to God. "Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus
Christ in sincerity."</p>

<h3>Letters from Prisoners.</h3>


<p>The extracts from letters found in this chapter are gathered
from my correspondence with those within prison walls
who have been encouraged by the way and have received
help; many of them having borne testimony to a clear conversion
and a life of service for the Lord, even within prison
walls. These will serve to show their appreciation of any
effort made in their behalf. They have been a source of
great encouragement to me in my work.</p>

<p>I should like to give more of similar character, and all
more in detail, would space permit, but let these suffice
as examples of the thousands of letters I have received
during these twenty years from my "children." The
names and that which might identify the individuals, I have
omitted; for many of them are now good citizens and some
are engaged in the work of the Lord. I have omitted many
references to the instrumentality which God has seen fit to
use in carrying His message of love to these souls, giving
only what others thought were needed to show the writers'
appreciation and gratitude. I have ever dealt with these,
when present and by correspondence, as souls whom I must
meet at the Judgment. The honor and praise for what good
may have been accomplished belongs to Him whom I serve,
and who has given me the commission, "Go and preach the
Gospel."</p>

<p>My Dear and Much Esteemed Friend: As I sit here in
the prison tonight I ponder upon the kind and good advice
you gave me, and my heart of hearts goes out to you in
gratitude.</p>

<p>My past life has been a blank, in fact, an utter failure.
But since I saw you I have come to God in all simplicity
and have asked Him to give me a new spirit and pardon
my past sins; and since I have offered up this petition my
heart seems lighter. How often have I cried out in my
despair, O I am weary of the conflicts and strife of this life!
weary with the constant struggle for a higher and better
life! And when I see the lives of yourself and others&mdash;so
Christlike, and hear you say mid darkest shadows: "Not
my will, but thine be done," then I think of the rebellion in
my heart and so oft find when I feel the path I am treading
leaves the sunshine all behind.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">As the way looks dark before me and the end I cannot see,</span>
<span class="i1">Oft I long to drop the burdens and from sorrow be set free,</span>
<span class="i0">But I know such thoughts are sinful; God knows best the way</span>
<span class="i1">That will lead from earth's dark shadows to the brighter realms of day.</span>
</div>

<p>Words cannot express the comfort I have received since
I saw you. I have prayed to God to help me every night
and morning since and as I sit and ponder upon the past
and think of the wasted hours that have drifted by, it puts
me in mind of a song I learned when I was a child. I will
only write you a couple of verses to let you see how true
they are.</p>

<p>To My Dear Sister in Christ: "Whosoever believeth in
Him shall not perish but have everlasting life." I believe
and trust in God. My faith and my belief grow stronger
every day of my life. I pray to God to keep me from evil,
and to make me worthy of His kingdom, that I may meet
you there, for I am a better man for knowing you. God
bless you, my dear sister! My heart is full of love for my
God, and for my fellowman. I cannot find words to express
my feelings or to tell you how happy I am, and how
precious Christ is to my soul. It passes my understanding.
But I am satisfied, for I know that Christ has come into my
heart to dwell. There are no doubts, no fears, everything
is well with me. I thank God for it, and I want to see
every one around me enjoying this great gift which comes
from God. O how it would have rejoiced your soul to have
been with us the last evening of the old year. We had
a prayer meeting. I am told that there were one hundred
and forty men in the chapel. Our warden was the first to
testify. Many acknowledged Christ to be precious to their
souls. There are many here that are feeling uncomfortable.
They will be at the feet of Jesus yet, crying for mercy.
Pray for them. Pray for us all. Only think of it, one
hundred and forty prisoners on their knees and their warden
kneeling with them! O it was a blessed sight! I never
heard Chaplain Barnes pray as he did that night. His
whole soul went out to God. How he did plead with God
for the salvation of our souls. God bless the chaplain. God
bless everyone on the face of the earth, and may every
one see as I see, and enjoy what I am enjoying. In His
paths there is peace, and that in keeping of His commandments
there is great reward.</p>

<p>There is a young man here by the name of Charles B.
He has formed good resolutions with beginning of the new
year. I tell him that he cannot keep them without he gets
divine help. I am praying for him. Please make mention
of him in your prayers, and with the help of God we will
have him at the feet of Jesus crying for mercy. We had
a prayer meeting last week and I am informed that we are
to have them often. How good it is of the warden! God
bless him. He is always looking for some way to benefit
us. I praise the Lord for it.</p>

<p>I leave the prison this year. I hope that I may meet you
again on earth. If not permitted, I will live a life that shall
make me worthy of the kingdom and meet you there. I
thank you for the letter read this day to us by the chaplain.</p>

<p>My Dear Kind Lady: In answer to your request I address
this note to you trusting that this may be the commencement
of life in a different sphere to that which I have
heretofore moved in, so do not think that I am flattering
if I tell you the truth. I have traveled from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, from the British Possessions to the Gulf of
Mexico. I have moved in all classes of society and have
been a close observer. I have made myself acquainted with
all kinds of religious sects from the Jewish synagogues to
Mormonism, Protestantism in all its various forms, Catholicism,
as well as Spiritualism, and I found so much hypocrisy
and inconsistency existing that I felt inclined to believe
Christianity a fraud, but I could see plainly that there were
in every church some few that I could feel were true Christians.
I could feel a secret convincing power almost irresistible
when in their society, but it always seemed strange
to me why more true converts were not made in proportion
to the great work done.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the handling of God's cause should
only be entrusted to those that are godly&mdash;then the fruit
will bear witness to the quality and health of the tree. God
will prosper His own, but it is not natural that the Lord
can or will prosper one who is half God's and half Satan's.
That is why I have remained in the world. I am earnest
in everything I do. It is my nature, I cannot help it. Therefore,
if I ever become a Christian, bold and true and faithful,
too, I'll be.</p>

<p>I must refer to that now which I spoke of in the first of
this note. All the convicts in this prison have been moved
by your godly advice and teaching as this prison has never
been moved before, either by man or woman. You won the
hearts of the hardest criminals and a noticeable change for
the better has taken place. We all pray God to bless and
protect you wherever His wisdom may lead you, and even
though this prayer comes from convicts, perhaps God will
hear us. Some of us have been convicted by man, while
God, being just, and our own consciences declare us innocent.
Those of us who are innocent and can suffer with
patience, what a virtue we possess. Such strength comes
only of God.</p>

<p>I must close for want of room. Please answer if you
have time. We hope to see you soon again.</p>

<p>Dear Friend: Your visit to this place was a great blessing.
A great many of the men often speak of you and say
that by the help of God they are going to live better the
rest of their days.</p>

<p>I will thank you for every paper or good book you may
send to us. The way that we do about papers and books

<p>You have our prayers and best wishes and we hope you

<p>There have been deaths here since you were here. Neither

<p>Dear Kind Friend: Through the kindness of the Warden,
we received your letter, with the song and accompanying
texts, and I take the liberty of answering it and thanking
you for your kindness in thus remembering us. I was
seriously impressed by your kind words of sympathy and
exhortation when you came to the prison and I should have
liked to have spoken to you, but feared to trespass too much
on your time. I am here under a life sentence for the
crime of murder, committed during a fit of delirium resulting
from drink. I have been here three years. Hitherto
my life has been anything but a happy one. I was driven
from home at the age of ten years, after the death of my
mother. Since then I have associated with gamblers and
men of that stamp, and the result of my ill-directed course
is my present unhappy condition. What I have suffered,
no one but myself will ever know. I would gladly end my
life, if my death could blot out the crimes for which I suffer.
I have one friend, who has taken an interest in me, and who
has written me several kind letters and I thank God for
letting me have one kind and faithful friend. She is weak
in body, but strong in mind, and a faithful servant of God.
She has advised me to give myself to God, and since you
were here I have resolved to try to do so. Peace of mind
is what I want, but fear I shall never attain it. I hope to
hear from you again. Most of my fellow prisoners have
read your letter and all entertain the greatest respect for
you. Some to whom your kind words and motherly advice
have brought tender memories, desire to be remembered to
you.</p>

<p>You are passing through ... , where I have lived and
where I spent the happiest of my boyhood days, but they
are gone. I hope you may meet some of my old companions
and that they may be benefited by your kind words.</p>

<p>Dear Sister Wheaton: I was pleased beyond expression
to receive your letter. It came like a benediction. I shall
never forget you. The few words spoken have left an
impress upon the tablets of memory that time can not efface.
You can tell the boys wherever you see them in prison or
out that Jesus is near&mdash;ever near. Tell them that I know
that no locks ever were made that can lock the Saviour out.
He came to me when I was, oh, so lonely, so broken-hearted
and despairing! You know just how it was I was saved.</p>

<p>I am innocent in the presence of God, and still I am
here; but never alone. Jesus is ever with me. Oh, how
I wish every one in the wide, wide world could know our
Saviour! How true is the fourteenth chapter of John, and
especially the eighteenth verse: "I will not leave you comfortless.
I will come unto you." Never in all my persecution
and imprisonment has my Lord failed in that promise.
I am very hopeful. My innocence is recognized and I hope
soon to be at liberty. Had any one told me twelve months
ago that this was all for my good I should have laughed
them to scorn; but, thank God, I know it now. This life
is but a few days at most compared to the home beyond,
and I can and do say, "God's will be done." He can do no
wrong, and right must prevail. God bless and prosper you
until you go home.</p>

Germantown, Ark., Nov. 29, 1889.
</p>

<p>My Dear Sister: I am at Germantown at the present
time working on Mr. W. H. Ward's farm or plantation,
and the Warden of the camp and the guards are followers
of Christ. There are several of the boys with me which
were at Coal Hill at the time you were there.</p>

<p>O sister, God worked that all right, His name be praised.
One of the Coal Hill wardens got five years in the penitentiary.
That is God's work.</p>

<p>God be with you and bless you is my daily prayer, that
you will keep strong and well to preach to the poor prisoners
and pray for them that they will "flee from the wrath
to come." O sister it is terrible to think and study over
how the Book of Life tells us about that everlasting torment,
and how sweet it is to think that there is a life eternal.</p>

<p>Sister, there are three ways, "a broad road," "a narrow
way" and "a highway," that are thus brought to our attention
in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>The broad road to destruction, the narrow way to life,
the highway to holiness.</p>

<p>"And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall
be called the way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass
over it; but it shall be for those, the wayfaring man, though
fools shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor any
ravenous beast shall go up thereon; it shall not be found
there, but the redeemed shall walk there." Isa. 35: 8, 9.
Sister, am I right or wrong?</p>

<p>The first great judgment (trial and sentence) was at the
beginning, in Eden, when the whole human race, as represented
in its head, Adam, stood on trial before God. The
result of that trial was the verdict&mdash;guilty, disobedient, unworthy
of life; and the penalty inflicted was <em>Death</em>. "Dying,
thou shalt die," and so "In Adam all die." But, dear
sister, the sweet and dear thought in "Christ we all shall
live" is a great comfort to our poor souls. Ours is a rugged,
steep and narrow way, and were it not that strength is furnished
for each successive step of the journey, we never
could reach the goal, but our Captain's word is encouraging:
"Be of good courage, I have overcome"; "My grace
is sufficient for thee, and my strength is made perfect in
weakness." The difficulties of this way are to act as a
separating principle to sanctify and refine "a peculiar people,"
to be "Heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ."
In view of these things, "let us come boldly to the throne
of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help
in time of need," "while we fight the good fight of faith
and lay hold of the crown of life." Immortality, the divine
nature.</p>

<p>Sister, I hope that we may meet together here in this
world once more in life so we can talk about what Jesus
has wrought, God will be with you. I know He is with me.
Sister, I gave myself to Jesus and I feel more satisfied, and
how sweet it is to have Jesus with you.</p>

<p>Dear Sister: I received yours of the 28th. I am so glad
that you have not forgotten me, and the words which I
heard you say, although it is a long time since you said them
at Coal Hill. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
shalt be saved." Acts xvi., 31. Jails are dark, dull, damp,
loathsome places even now; but they were worse in the
apostolic times. I imagine tonight we are standing in the
Philippian Dungeon. Do you not feel the chill? Do you
not hear the groan of those incarcerated ones who for ten
years have not seen the sunlight, and the deep sigh of
women who remember their father's house, and mourn over
their wasted estates? Listen again. It is enough. Oh, it
is the cough of the consumptive, or the struggle of one in
a nightmare of a great horror. You listen again, and hear
a culprit, his chains rattling as he rolls over in his dreams,
and you say: "God pity the prisoner." But there is another
sound in that prison. It is a song of joy and gladness.
What a place to sing in. The music comes winding through
the corridors of the prison and in all dark wards the whisper
is heard: "What's that? What's that?" It was the song
of Silas and Paul in prison, and they cannot sleep. Jesus
went to prison then, and as you say He will and does come
nowadays also to visit the prisoners as they are shut up.
God will be and is our helper. I will not fear, He leadeth
me in pastures green.</p>

and glad to hear from you. But, sister, I am so glad to
have some Christian friend to write to me in a place of
temptation and trouble. I know that Jesus is my rock and
my salvation and a shelter in a storm. Jesus is with me
right now. He is waiting for us every day and hour. O,
how many will there be that will call on Christ on that
day, when the book of the Lord will be opened, with the
seven seals, and who will be able to open the seals? No one
is able to open it but the Lamb. Sister, this is my idea
and opinion about that Day: There will be a great big
scale, with a cross beam and Satan will be on one side of
it and the people of all trades will be weighed, and if
Christ the Son of God and our Redeemer is not there to
balance them, what will become of them? Won't they be
thrown down in hell?</p>

we have our regular meeting every Sunday, and I will
never cease praying to the Lord that He may help me to live

<p>It is said that religionists make too much of the humanity
of Christ. I respond that they make too little. If some
doctor or surgeon of His day, standing under the cross,
had caught one drop of the blood on his hands and analyzed
it, it would have been found to have the same plasma, the
same disk, the same fiber, the same albumen. It was unmistakably
human blood. It is a man that hangs there.
His bones are of the same material as ours. His nerves are
as sensitive as ours. If it were an angel being despoiled, I
would not feel it so much, for it belongs to a different
being. But my Saviour is a man and my whole sympathy
is aroused. Jesus our King is dying. Let couriers carry
the swift dispatch. His pains are worse; He is breathing
a last groan; through his body quivers the last anguish.
The King is dying; the King is dead! His royal blood is
shed.</p>

<p>I can imagine something of how the spikes felt; of how
the temples burned; what deathly sickness seized His
heart; of how mountain and city and mob swam away
from His dying vision; something of that cry for help that
makes the blood of all ages curdle with horror: "My God,
my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" * * *</p>

<p>Yours of May 25th received yesterday in this camp and
contents duly noted. How it thrills the hearts of the boys
to hear the reading of a letter written by the hand of
"Mother Wheaton," the friend of the unfortunate ones.
Dear Christian Mother, you can't imagine the encouragement
it gives to the boys here, especially those who are trying
to do right. Your work has been implanted here so
very deep that God cannot, according to His promise, obliterate
it, for He approves of all good works. You shall
have our prayers, and we desire to have your presence
again when possible.</p>

<p>I intended to take your letter to Rattlesnake Camp No. 4
to read to the boys up there, as Capt. Brock promised me
I might go, but for some reason, I know not what, I failed
to get off, but I do hope and believe the way will be opened
for us prison-bound boys who desire to do a work for Him
to do it without fear.</p>

<p>I received also enclosed in your letter a most interesting
pamphlet of "Capt. Ball's Experience," which is so grand.
Also another of the "Widow and the Judge."</p>

<p>We have a very good Sunday school here now, and I
am trying to make it as interesting as I possibly can, and
any books and Sunday school papers and catechisms you
can send us will be quite a favor. That would have been
my business at No. 4 Camp to-day, if I could have gone, to
organize a Sunday school.</p>

<p>I must close by asking an interest in your prayers. Write
often.</p>

<p>

<p>Dear Madam:
</p>

<p>Your invitation given any of the prisoners who may wish
to write, I for one accept. I was greatly impressed with
your words of truth and the earnest, determined manner
in which they were spoken. I believe they proved an exception
to the routine of professed Christianity we are used
to, and have set more than one mind to thinking of their
spiritual condition. I assure you they were not without
effect, and that you are engaged in a noble work, of which
I and others would be glad to hear more.</p>

<p>True it is that in the world around us are many persons
struggling with poverty as great as ours, who are loaded
with cares and anxieties which seem to hinder them in the
service of God. There are many who cannot offer him a
pure heart which has never been stained by sin, yet in the
grief for misspent time and neglected grace would gladly
atone for the past by fervent, grateful love, casting themselves
upon the mercy of the Saviour.</p>

<p>I am an old soldier, have fought in the late war, but
the greatest battle I have yet to fight is with myself&mdash;the
battle of reformation.</p>

<p>Almighty God, in His wondrous wisdom, has chosen His
saints from every rank of life&mdash;some poor and unknown to
the world while they are in it; others great and powerful;
no two have been exactly alike, even in their way of pleasing
the Lord.</p>

<p>The "boys" here are satisfied your mission was for good,
and left them knowing that for once they were not locked
up within the hearing of false professors. To say that
"locks" would not be necessary to hold a congregation
within your hearing would be well founded. For a great
many others this could not be said.</p>

<p>The boys from Block 9 send you their respects, and
would be glad to hear from you again; would be glad to
hear that you received this and that our appreciation of
your service be accepted.</p>

<p>Your postal of the 5th to hand. The boys are all glad to

<p>Mr. McL. was acquitted and was the proudest boy I
ever saw. The St. Louis boy also got free and went home

<p>There has been a great change in the prisoners since you
were here. They are always praying and singing, and you
are remembered in every prayer. I don't think I am the
same boy that came to jail; I know my poor old mother
will be proud of me when I see her again. She lives in
Mobile, Alabama, and it has been three years since she
saw me, but I am praying to meet her soon and be a son
to her, as I never was before. I feel like I could teach
young men some good lessons if I get out of this place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton,
</p>

<p>Dear Madam: Your welcome and interesting letter to
hand and contents noted, being exceedingly pleased to hear
from you. In response would state, your letter, though a
great surprise, has been read by many of the inmates of this
institution with great interest, you being the only one, so far,
who has shown enough respect for us to address a few lines
to us by mail. For this kindly remembrance and respect,
please accept our united thanks, with the wish that as you
are journeying along life's pathway you may escape many
of the annoyances which you have been subjected to in the
past, while dispensing the gospel tidings to a class of unfortunates.
After your departure from here, am pleased to
state, the "Boys" have taken a deeper interest in Jesus and
His works than ever before, and I verily believe that were
you to come again you would have no difficulty in bringing
many of them to the foot of the Cross. Bibles that have lain
for months in cells, covered with dust, have been taken up
and read with avidity, selecting texts as you suggested for
future guidance, and many are the prayers and kind words
which ascend nightly to the Throne of Grace in your behalf&mdash;prayers
for your future guidance and welfare, with health
to sustain you in your glorious work of reclaiming the erring
and fallen. God speed the good work along! We wish
there were more like you, to bring a few kind and cheering
words to sustain us, while undergoing this isolation. Your
voice has lingered in our ears ever since you left, and many
of the boys here would like to secure, if they possibly could,
a copy of that wonderful song you sang for us, "Throw Out
the Life-line." If you would kindly forward a copy, as it
is not in our hymn-books, it would be very acceptable.</p>

<p>You may rest assured, no firmer, truer or better friends
are to be found than those you possess in the Utah Penitentiary.
Allow us to hope that when comparing this institution
with some of the grander ones you may visit in the
East, you will not speak disparagingly of your boys out
West, but remember there are as many honest hearts beating
beneath striped jackets here as you will find anywhere, with
none more willing to do you a favor. In conclusion, accept
our united and kindest regards. Hoping that after your
life's labors are finished on this earth, you may find that
"Haven of Rest," where it shall be said to you, "Well done,
thou good and faithful servant; enter ye into the kingdom
of Heaven," trusting these few lines may give you further
encouragement, and hoping to hear from you again, with
united thanks for past remembrance, I remain,</p>

<p>I received your kind note through our Brother Burge. I
am thankful for your words to us and for the encouragement
I received through you. I am trying to live a Christian
life, to follow the teachings of the words of God in the
book He has given. I am persuaded of myself I can do
nothing, but by the help of God and our Saviour I am able
to resist temptations and sin. The world looks down upon
me from two standpoints&mdash;the one because of my color, and
the other because I try to serve the living God through
Christ our Lord. I feel that I am weak and need much
help, both from the Lord and from the brethren and sisters.
I need your prayers daily to help me in my surroundings
and trials. We are hated and mocked, but this does not
move us. My faith is strong and I will, through the grace
of God, meet you in Heaven. In my imagination I still
hear those words that you spoke to us, and I hope they will
continue to ring in my ear.</p>

<p>Dear Mother Wheaton:
</p>

<p>Your kind letter was handed to me by our Superintendent
to-day, and we were more than pleased to hear from you.
May our Father in Heaven protect and keep you for many
years to come in the faithful work of rescuing the souls of
men who are so far astray that each one saved seems like a
miracle. Many a prayer has gone up from the solitudes of
our prison cells for Mother Wheaton's health and success,
and many of us in conversation have oft repeated, "God
bless Mother Wheaton!" But we have not lost sight of
Jesus, always our Friend. We have services every Sunday.
Mother Smith (God bless her!) comes once a month, and
each Sunday our pulpit is occupied by some minister from
the city. Then some night during the week our choir has
rehearsal; so you see, we have plenty of opportunity to
worship and listen to the divine Word, and in consequence
we are very grateful to our kind officials, who earnestly look
out for our spiritual welfare, especially Mr. Downing, our
good Christian Superintendent, who would not rest easy if he
thought one of us was in want of anything that he could
obtain for us that would be for our good. We often think
of the difference between some other prisons and ours. "Oh,
Father in Heaven, not as we will, but as Thou wilt, but
spread a little divine love in those quarters where it is so
much needed"&mdash;that is often our prayer.</p>

<p>God bless you and protect you in your noble work, and
may the jewels in your crown be many, are the prayers of
many of the inmates of this institution, and when you come
again many an honest hand will unite with yours in our
expression of love and faithfulness for Him who died on
Calvary, not in the arms of a loving mother, but between
two such men as many of us have been; yet one of them
dwells with Him in Paradise, which proves to a certainty
that He saves to the uttermost. God bless you again. Write
us often, and when you reach those pearly gates there will
be those to meet you who will say, "You showed me the
way."</p>

<p>Dear Sister in the Lord:
</p>

<p>Yours of the 5th at hand. I always rejoice to hear from
you, or to hear you speak, for your words are words of comfort,
and are after the doctrine of our Lord and Master and
according to the Scripture. It is a great comfort to me to
hear or speak with those that live in Christ Jesus. No I have
no thought of turning back to the poor and weak elements of
this world. By the help of the Lord I will press on to the
ends that I may claim all the promises, and I want to be
found faithful in all good works, and in doing good to those
that have need. The promise you spoke of can be found in
Revelation, 14:12. You ask if I will seek to be such. Yes,
with all my heart. God, that knows all our hearts, knows
that my desire is to live and work for His sake and for His
glory. As for me, I am not worthy to be called His child,
but only a servant, because I have wasted my life in sin
when I ought to have served my God and Lord. But four
years ago the Lord drew me unto Him. I repented of my
ways, gave my heart and soul to God the Father, and Jesus
our Lord. I received forgiveness of my sins, and not many
days after I received the promise of my Lord. That was
the promise of the Comforter, which came to me&mdash;even me.
And now shall I turn back? No, God helping me, I will
endure all things; for He is able to keep me in the hour of
temptation. And oh! His promises are so true to them
that put their trust in Him. In Isaiah, 41st chapter and
10th verse, and again in 1st Kings, 19th chapter, 7th verse,
we are told the journey is too great for us without God's
help. But if we accept the help we shall be faithful to the
end. And here is another promise that He will help in time
of need: "Lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of
the world." (Matt. 28:20.)</p>

<p>He has promised to reward us according to our works.
(Rev. 22:12.) I have done nothing worthy of reward. But
you have labored and have kept the faith, and God will reward
you for all your trials and tribulations, and give you
a crown that will never fade. Yes, God helping me, I will
meet you in Heaven, where there is no more sorrow and no
more weeping, but joy in our Saviour. May God bless you.
May He give you health and strength to the end, is my
prayer. Pray for me, for the prayer of the righteous availeth
much.</p>

<p>Dear Madam: I write to thank you for those pamphlets
you sent me, and I think I can say they did me good. At
any rate, I am trying to faithfully follow their suggestions.
I practically devour any of that kind of reading, for, thank
God, I do hunger and thirst after instruction in His word&mdash;I
should like to have said righteousness, but I don't&mdash;there!
I cannot finish what I was going to say, for a blessed thought
has just come to me&mdash;that is, Abraham believed God, and it
was counted to him for righteousness. I not only believe
God, but Jesus Christ also. So I believe I may say I hunger
and thirst after righteousness. Anyhow, I pray every day
to get nearer to God. You will be glad to hear that I have
decided to leave all and follow Him. I have consecrated
my life to His service. When I get out, wherever I feel
that He calls me, I shall go there, if it is to China. I am
praying for sanctification. I want to get so close to God
as to always be able to feel His presence. This is just two
weeks since you were here, and I started to serve God.
Praise the Lord, I think I am justified in saying that I am
a new lad.</p>

<p>I have given up tobacco and don't feel the need of it any
more than if I had never tasted it. I have given up profanity
just as easily. Now I want to read the Bible every day.
Since you were here I have read Corinthians I and II, Revelations,
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, and am now reading
the Acts of the Apostles. Before you came I had thought a
little of being a Christian, but had not taken any steps
towards it, but you decided me, and I thank you for it.</p>

<p>I must close now or my paper will give out. Pray for
me that I may receive sanctification and have the indwelling
of the Holy Ghost. God bless you.</p>

I might be found faithful to the end, and I ask your prayers
for me to Him who is able to save to the uttermost. I am

December 25. We had the follies of this world without the

it to a little boy in Montana that I used to know. We still
continue our Bible class and have several new members.
We have changed the time from Thursday until Sunday,
on account of some of the boys who work on the farm.</p>

<p>I got a good letter from a friend in Kansas not long ago.
He tells me that my wife and little girls have joined the
Christian Church. The happiest days of my life were spent
with them, and if there is one of us four who has to be lost
I hope it may be me. I want your prayers for our Bible
class and that God will make me a better man; and especially
for my wife and children I want your prayers. It
will be four years to-morrow since I have seen them.</p>

<p>Some of the boys often speak of you, and I can assure
you of a welcome by us if you ever come this way again.
May God bless you and sustain you in this world for many
years to come, is my prayer. The text of the sermon we
heard to-day was John 3:16.</p>

<p>Madam: The privilege of writing is accorded me by the
rules of this institution, and as I have no friends to whom
I write, I will address this letter to you. I have not taken
any great interest in your work, but have heard you speak
before you visited this place last February, and under similar
circumstances.</p>

<p>All are doing nicely here and are looking forward to the

of the yard, as we celebrate the Fourth then.</p>

<p>The Christian Endeavor Society is getting along nicely,
I guess, though I have not been present at their last two
or three meetings, but some of the boys seem to take considerable
interest in the work.</p>

<p>The front yard is very pretty. All the flowers are in
bloom and nature seems to bless the convicts as well as
those whose conduct permits them to remain out in a cruel
world.</p>

<p>Flower Mission Day was observed here June 20th. Some
ladies of the W. C. T. U. distributed some flowers and
spoke in the chapel. Told us of the sufferings of Jennie
Cassidy of Kentucky, the originator of Flower Mission Day,
invoked a divine blessing on us, and sent us to our cells,
feeling that our lot was not so bad as others have had to
endure.</p>

<p>The prison is about the same, six hundred males and ten
or twelve females; some changes in the discipline; the
lock-step is dispensed with; we are allowed two books a
week from the library, and other changes which lighten our
burden.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; requests me to answer your kind and most welcome
letter. I was thinking of you this morning, and of
your mission on earth, and how you had spent your life in
the service of the Lord, and in trying to benefit others. We
regard you as the Good Samaritan, and pray that the Lord
will bless you in your work wherever you may go. The
members of the Bible class unite in sending you their love

us again. According to nature, your earthly mission will
soon come to a close, but your acts of kindness and deeds of
mercy will live on forever. Remember us in your prayers.
It is written that the prayers of the righteous avail much.
Our class has increased considerably since you were here.
Some of the boys seem to be very much in earnest and sincerely
repent of their past conduct. I hope to live the remainder
of my life in the service of the Lord, and I hope
to meet you in a brighter and a better world, where parting
and sorrow are no more; where our tears are all wiped
away, and the light of the Lord shines forever.</p>

those who I knew would read and appreciate them. I also
showed your letter to several, and intended reading it, or
having it read, during church yesterday morning, but our

During the week I will pass it around to as many as I can.
All to whom I showed the letter seemed glad to hear from

prayers, and said to tell you they hoped you would be able
to visit the prison again soon.</p>

<p>I am sorry I haven't a more favorable report of Christian
progress in the prison; but Satan seems to hold the upper
hand, and there has been no conversion for some time, and
there has been quite a number of Christian boys sent out,
and a great many new men came in of late, which may
account for the small attendance at services.</p>

<p>I hope the Lord will open the way for some good revivalist
to come to Yuma and stay for a while at least. This

heaven.</p>

<p>During the past few years I have been acquainted with

For many years her time has been almost wholly given to
the work of relieving the distressed and discouraged in their
cells, and in prison chapels.</p>

<p>Her songs and words of encouragement, mingled with
tears, have caused the feelings of depression and sadness
to flee away, and those bowed down with sorrow to grasp
a ray of hope and look forward with renewed energy to a
higher life, trusting in Him who is able to keep. Many
years of continued evangelistic work in the penitentiaries
and prisons of America have given her a wide range of
experiences of prison life, a description of which cannot
fail to be of intense interest to every reader. It was partially
due to her untiring zeal that I was moved to write
the book entitled "Behind the Prison Bars." Her written
words will continue to warn and comfort after her departure
from this world to her home beyond the cares of life.</p>

quarantine has kept you away. I feel very grateful to you
for taking an interest in my dear boy, for he is still very
dear to me.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine my feelings all these years, knowing
he was behind gloomy walls. My health has given way
two or three times on account of it. Like so many others,
he thought he knew best, and left a good home to go roving.

his time is up in October. I hope to see him once more
and keep him with me, for I am growing old&mdash;am nearly
sixty-two.</p>

<p>Praise God for salvation this afternoon! I am glad I
found your address, for I have wanted to write to you for a
long time and tell you the result of your visit to R. State
Prison, where you talked with my precious father.</p>

<p>He wrote me soon after you left and said you left him
under awful conviction. He confessed and forsook his
sins and is now a man saved by the blood that was shed
on the cross for him. He said that he was restless from
the time you left until he found Jesus. He told how you
and a young lady talked and prayed with him, and how,
after he retired, he rolled and tossed in awful agony until
about eleven o'clock, when he cried to God for mercy. God
heard his cries and came to his release. O hallelujah! It
just makes me shout to read his letters now. I can tell
by them that he is really resting in Jesus. He before seldom
wrote more than two pages, and now he writes from
fifteen to twenty-four. And oh, such letters! I just can't
help but cry for joy when I read them and realize that my
precious papa is serving the only true and living God. I
give God the glory and all of the honor for what has been
done; and I praise God for using you as an instrument
through whom He worked. Eternity alone can reveal the
result.</p>

<p>My heart is full of praises to Jesus my King this evening.
He has done so much for me lately. He blesses me
in soul and body and supplies all my needs.</p>

<p>I may go to C. soon and try to do something for my
father. Pray that God may lead me and that the devil
may not hinder in any way, if God sees fit to release papa
from prison. I am perfectly resigned to God's will.</p>

will appear in the next issue. Always let me know where
to find you. I would have written sooner, but have been

I have been visiting those camps pretty regularly since you
left here. You put it on me and I am trying to be faithful.
You asked me in your letter if you knew me. Yes, I met
you here. It was in front of my store. You held the street
service here at Ashburn, while waiting for the train, and
I was with you until the train left. Well, sister, I will
never get done praising God for ever meeting you. It
marked a new epoch in my experience. I want you to take
my paper on your heart. Ask the Holy Spirit to run it for
me and the Father to supply financial help. I am trusting
Him for it. How glad the prisoners in the camp will be
to hear from you in this way. I will send up to both the
camps a bundle of the issue containing your letter. I want
you all to pray for the South, that a deeper work may be

<h4>FROM AN EX-PRISONER.</h4>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Sioux City, Ia., Jan. 31, 1901.
</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton: I don't suppose you will remember me,
but possibly you may, as I think I was one of the most
wretched in or out of prison at that time. It was at Sioux
Falls, So. Dak., between three and four years ago, if I remember
correctly. You visited the prison and spoke to us
in chapel, and later in the day you and a lady with you,
came around to the cells. I was in cell No. 13. You shook
hands with me and asked, "Are you a Christian?" I replied,
"No." Again you asked, "Have you ever been one?"
"No." "Will you meet me in Heaven?" you asked again,
and I answered, "I will try to." You spoke only a few
words, saying, "Do not be discouraged." These few words
and that warm hand-shake helped me very much. I was
indeed much discouraged. Life seemed dark indeed. I
was serving an eleven years' sentence. I was under deep
conviction of sin. Not long after that the blessed Christ
came into my heart. I believed on His name and He saved
my soul. Two years ago last August I was pardoned from
the prison. The 17th of last March I became Superintendent
of a Rescue Mission in Dakota, and for ten months or
nearly that I was there and the Lord blessed our efforts by
saving souls. I am now married. My wife was converted
in the mission last June. She is an accomplished musician
and singer and, the Lord being willing, we expect to go
out and preach the gospel among railroad men in the near
future.</p>

<p>I have often thought of you and your labor of love among
prisoners. May God bless and encourage you in the work,
is my earnest prayer. I heard that you were in Sioux Falls
at the prison a short time ago. I did not know it in time
to see you. If the prisoners only knew what joy and peace
there is in the service of Jesus, it seems to me they would
yield their hearts to Him. Again I wish you godspeed in
your work. May you have many precious jewels for the
Master's crown. To Him belong the praise and glory.</p>

<p>Good-bye, and God bless you and the sister that was with
you. Never be discouraged. Jesus loves and uses you.</p>

<blockquote><p class="head">
Sioux Falls, S. Dak., Feb. 9, 1904.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. R. Wheaton.
</p>

<p>Dear Sister: Your card of November was received.
Hope you will pardon me for not writing before. I am glad
that you are still trusting Jesus, and working in His vineyard.
May God bless, comfort, strengthen and keep you.</p>

<p>Jesus is coming again, perhaps soon. It may be that we
shall be alive when He comes. If so we shall be caught up
together with the dead in Christ to meet Him in the air,
so shall we ever be with Him. Blessed be His name.
(I Thess. 4-17.) I want to exalt Him. I want my daily life
to be a testimony of His power to save and to keep. Many
years of my life were spent in sin. Finally I was tried, convicted
and sentenced to state's prison for a long term of
years. God says: "Whatsoever a man soweth that shall
he also reap, for He that soweth to his flesh shall of the
flesh reap corruption, but he that soweth to the Spirit shall
of the Spirit reap life everlasting." (Galatians 6:7, 8.)
God's word is true.</p>

<p>I found my mind giving away and my body a physical
wreck. I read the Bible and God showed me that I was
a lost man. I tried to destroy my life, but God in his love
and mercy would not permit it. I was in great darkness.
I said to a friend, there is no hope for me in this life or
the life to come, but I did not know Jesus Christ nor His
saving power. God sent His ministers each Sunday morning
to preach the blessed gospel, and one Sunday morning
He sent "Mother Wheaton" to us. In the afternoon, I believe
it was, she visited us in our cells. I had quarreled with
my cell-mate, and he had left me. Mrs. Wheaton came and
shook hands with me, and asked if I was a Christian. I
said, "No." Again she asked, "Have you ever been a Christian?"
I replied, "No." She said, "Will you meet me in
Heaven?" I said, "I will try." With a warm hand-shake
and a few words of encouragement, she left me. God
helped me to believe in Jesus Christ, and there came into
my life joy and peace such as I had never known before,
even in my best days on the outside.</p>

<p>After my conversion I asked God if it was His will that
I might be pardoned out. He also heard and answered that
prayer. God is love. He loves the vilest sinner. To-day
I have a loving Christian wife and two lovely children.

<p>My Dear Mrs. Wheaton:
</p>

<p>I thank you so much for your letter. I was greatly
pleased in reading it. I will be so glad to see you when
you come. I realize, as you say, that I have never fully let
go of myself in the Master's work, but I have given my life
to Him, and if I know my own heart, I am willing to be
and do anything He shall choose for me. I love to help
lost ones, and if the Lord should use me as He does you, I
believe I should be the happiest person in the world. Do
pray for me, won't you, that the Lord may lead me into
all His will? Time is flying, and soon all of our opportunities
will be over and our Lord will take us to Himself.
Pray that the Lord will keep me busy serving Him. I love
you and pray for you. May you be kept rejoicing in hope
even though you see nothing but sin and sorrow around
you. (Psalm 125:5, 6.)</p>

<p>My Dear Sister:
</p>

<p>I received your letter to-day. I have been thinking about
you and praying for you often, and see by your letter that
God has made all of your trials a blessing to you and know
that God can make up for any loss He lets us have. What
a hard time you did have, dear sister. I praise God for
bringing you through it with such joy. Sometimes it seems
true He does with us like He did with Job&mdash;just tells Satan
he may do everything but take our lives, and when our self-justification
and friends are gone, He joins us in with Himself
and makes us powerful in His own power. He knows
whether we want Him, and if we do we will be taken
through death to self and put to hard tests. It seems sometimes
as if He hides His face to let us suffer and say,
"Though He slay me yet will I trust Him." I am glad you
are with the people who hold you up in prayer. We need
one another's prayers in these times when Satan has so
many snares. Tula is well. She and Mildred send love.</p>

<p>To Christian Women:
</p>

<p>Dear Sisters: We have long known the bearer, Mrs. E.
R. Wheaton, and can testify as to her arduous labors for
the most needy classes. It was our privilege to have her in
our Home for one week and we certainly received the Lord's
blessing during that time. We are working for Christ, but
her labors are more abundant, her trials far greater. As she
goes forth without commission or salary she must depend
entirely upon God. He usually supplies her through His
people. Few of us could work where and as she does, but
we may lovingly minister to her necessity and the dear
Lord will surely bless in so doing. Yours in Christ,</p>

<p>The writer of the following sketch was an orphan girl making her
home, when I first met her, with some of my relatives in Iowa. She
was raised by her aunt and was kept in school and in society till
she was grown. Having been converted at the age of twelve years
and engaging some in Christian work, soon after my first acquaintance
with her she received a call from God to devote her life wholly
to His service. Being an orphan the Lord gave me a mother's love
and care for her. She went with me to the Missionary Training
Home at Tabor, from whence she went as a missionary to India.
While at the Home she was faithful in caring for orphan children,
etc., and traveled with me some, staying at one time several months
as a worker in a rescue home in Chicago, and later spending some
time in evangelistic work. I have elsewhere mentioned her trip with
me to the Pacific coast on her way to India.</p>

<blockquote><p>It was my privilege in the fall of 1903 to travel with
Mother Wheaton in Gospel work in prisons, jails, missions,
churches, etc. God made her a blessing to many souls who
needed a mother's love and sympathy. She always lifts up
Jesus, that souls might be drawn unto Him and be saved.
We first visited the Reformatory for Girls at Mitchelville,
Iowa. We were kindly received by the Superintendent who
had been a friend of Mother Wheaton's for several years.
He gave her the privilege of holding services in the chapel
with the several hundred girls. She also visited the girls
in their cottages, singing, praying and talking with them.</p>

<p>We then visited the prisons at the following places:
Moundsville, W. Va.; Baltimore, Md.; Allegheny, Pa.;
Columbus, Ohio; Waupun, Wis.; Stillwater, Minn.; Frankfort,
Ky.; Nashville and Brushy Mountain, Tenn.</p>

<p>In the hospital of the prison at Waupun we visited Mr.
Colgrove, a prisoner who was converted fifteen years previously
when Mother Wheaton was holding a service in the
prison. He was a life prisoner but he yielded to the conviction
of the Holy Spirit and was saved. During these
years he proved by his daily walk that he was a Christian.
He often conducted the devotional exercises, and he had
taught three Bible classes, two in German and one in
English, until his health failed. As I bade him goodbye he
said, "I will meet you in the better world if I never meet
you here again." He was in poor health and a few months
later died a triumphant death.</p>

<p>The prison physicians gave permission to visit the sick,
for they know the words of comfort and songs of cheer by
Mother Wheaton will give them encouragement and a desire
to live for the better world.</p>

<p>In a Gospel Mission I heard an ex-convict testify to how
God had saved him from a life of sin. He said that he
knew "Mother Wheaton" but perhaps she did not know
him dressed as he was; for when she had met him before
he was behind prison bars. He praised God for such a
person who was willing to work among that class of people.
I am sure there is much good accomplished in the
prisons for individuals as Mother Wheaton stands at the
door after services and shakes hands with the hundreds
of prisoners as they pass out. Her "God bless you" is
not soon forgotten. When her work is ended and the rewards
of the righteous are given, many will arise and call
her blessed.</p>

<h3>Sketches from Press Reports.</h3>


<p>My call being not only to the prison bound but to every
creature, the newspaper men have received their part of
the Gospel message and were often instrumental in heralding
some truth to their readers whom I have been unable
to reach in person. I have often been interviewed by reporters
regarding my work for the Master and they frequently
give accounts of meetings held in the prisons, on
the streets, etc., very correctly, though sometimes in a humorous
style and from that standpoint of the onlookers or
the prisoners. In this chapter I give a few sketches from
reports of my work clipped from the papers.</p>

UNFORTUNATE.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. WHEATON AMONG THE CRIMINALS AT THE PENITENTIARY.</p>

<p class="center">SHE VISITS THE HOSPITALS, JAIL AND WORK-HOUSE&mdash;AFFECTING
SCENES WHILE SHE PREACHED.</p>

<p>A white-haird lady, clad in deep mourning, carrying a
volume bound in morocco, visited the penitentiary yesterday.
This was Mrs. E. R. Wheaton. In a few minutes she
was delivering a sermon to the convicts. She is a remarkable
woman. Four years ago she left a luxurious home in
Ohio to preach the gospel to convicts, and since then has
exhorted in the penitentiaries of thirty-seven States. She
visits hospitals and the abodes of fallen women, also, and
has ministered to the wants of thousands of unfortunates.
An <cite>American</cite> reporter asked her how she happened to be
engaged in the work.</p>

<p>"No member of my family was ever in a prison or afflicted
as are those to whom I speak," she exclaimed; "my evangelical
work did not originate in any morbid sympathy because
of personal bereavement. I simply felt called of
God to preach his word to the people, and have entered upon
it for the remainder of my life. My heart and soul are in
it, and though I am far from my dear ones I am happy."</p>

<p>She had been speaking to the convicts but a few minutes
when the effect of her words of exhortation was visible.
At first the majority were listless, but as she warmed to her
cause they responded with closer attention and in fifteen
minutes every eye was fixed intently upon the gentle, earnest
woman, who sought to save their souls and bring a divine
light to their benighted lives. When she closed her discourse
and asked if any desired her prayers twenty hardened
men of crime, with tears in their eyes, raised their hands
and three advanced to the mourners' seat. With these she
prayed and every word was fraught with all the potent
power with which the voice of woman in prayer is capable.
The three unfortunates were moved as men seldom are and
at the close of the meeting professed conversion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton then visited the hospital department of the
penitentiary, after which she went to the jail, work-house
and city hospital and at each place delivered a discourse.
To-day she will see fallen women.&mdash;Nashville American,

<p>Elizabeth R. Wheaton, the celebrated prison evangelist,
visited the Buchanan county jail yesterday, and conducted
a religious service of forty minutes' length. The evangelist
pointed out the errors of her hearers and advised them to
make early amends. The evangelist assured the audience
that all they needed to be saved was faith. Wife murderer
Bulling was one of the evangelist's most attentive hearers,

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, prison evangelist, held
services in the county jail this afternoon, lecturing and singing
to the eleven prisoners there. She told in few words and
four songs the whole plan of salvation, and it didn't take
her but twenty minutes to do it. She talked a little while
and sang "I Will Tell the Wondrous Story," following with
a few words of comment her rich contralto voice burst into
"You Must Be Born Again," followed in the same way.
Then "It Pays to Serve the Lord," and "Parting to Meet no
More," closing with a short prayer. These songs coming in
the order they do, tell the whole story and make a very
pretty one.&mdash;Unidentified.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Evangelistic Service at Prison.</span></h4>

<p>Elizabeth Wheaton, a noble Christian woman who has
consecrated her life to work in prisons, jails, reformatories,
houses of correction, houses of refuge and hospitals, visited
our city Saturday, and after presenting her credentials was
given hearty permission to hold services at the prison on
Sunday, Father Murphy, the Catholic chaplain, whose day
it was to officiate, kindly consenting to this arrangement.
Her manner would probably not be agreeable to an sthetic
Christian audience in a fashionable, upholstered church,
but she knows how to reach the hearts of the men and boys
who wear the stripes, one of the prisoners, a Catholic, who
has been behind the bars for almost seventeen years, remarking
that this was the best service they had had there during
his long term of imprisonment. No one, be he Christian
or pagan, could have listened to the service at the prison
chapel last Sunday without being convinced that there was
an opening for unselfish work among prisoners and that
this lady was pre-eminently fitted for such work. There is
no mawkish sentimentality about her, but an all absorbing
zeal in the work of leading the criminals, the erring, the
lowly, the sick and the afflicted to Christ and a better life.
It is doubtful if there is an ordained minister in the land
who can do as much good in this field as this plain, unpretentious,
but thoroughly consecrated woman. She has
now been nearly five years in this work, and has visited
nearly every prison in the United States and Canada, a few
in Mexico, and also the jails, reformatories, houses of
refuge and hospitals in all the prominent cities through
which she has passed. She has traveled almost 100,000
miles and has never met with an accident. Wherever
she goes she is kindly received, non-Christians in
fact treat her better than those whose sympathy and co-operation
she has a right to expect. Thus does the world
ever recognize and honor earnest, conscientious and capable
laborers in the cause of God and humanity. She never
allows a collection to be taken up in her behalf, though frequently
invited to speak in churches, but accepts such offerings
as may come without solicitation. Last Sunday, while
she and the citizens in the audience were retiring from the
chapel, a Swedish servant girl, whose name is unknown to
the writer, took from her scanty purse a silver dollar and
gave it to Mrs. Wheaton. If the lesson of the story of the
widow's mite be true this humble girl's gift was greater
than that of the millionaire who gives thousands of dollars
toward the erection of a magnificent church edifice.&mdash;Stillwater,
Minn., Messenger, Oct. 27, 1888.</p>

<h4>FROM A PRISONER IN THE PRATT MINES STOCKADE, ALABAMA.</h4>

<p>
To the Chronicle:<br />
</p>

<p>Supposing a line or two from our prison, its surroundings,
happenings, etc., would be acceptable, prompts me to
drop you this.</p>

<p>The monotony of prison life is such that hardly anything
transpires, that would command the notice of a news reporter,
or draw an article from a newspaper correspondent.
But, Mr. Editor, we had something to take place here last
night that beats anything we ever saw or heard of.</p>

<p>About the time all the convicts had finished eating the
evening meal, Captain P. J. Rogers announced that all
should remain seated awhile, to hear preaching. Now to
hear preaching is no uncommon occurrence here, Brother
Rush preaches regularly for us, and occasionally other ministers
deliver discourses upon the importance of living the
life of a Christian, so when Capt. R. announced that we
were about to have preaching, no one experienced much
motion of spirit. The minds of those who gave the matter
any thought were picturing in expectation, a man, perhaps
baldheaded, clad in a long priestly robe with Bible and
Hymn-book in hand, and of a solemn, or sanctimonious
countenance, others, perhaps, drew a different man in appearance,
but none had drawn the picture correctly.</p>

<p>Imagine our surprise when instead of a man, a woman of
mature age, clad in the usual mourning apparel worn by
the ladies, armed with Bible and Hymn-book, mounted the
rostrum, and announced that she was going to preach to us.
This announcement at once produced the most profound
and reverential silence imaginable&mdash;every eye was at once
riveted upon the face of the fair preacher, whose countenance
wore a pleasant smile and indicated an affectionate
and amiable disposition, and complete surprise or amazement
was vivid upon the countenance of her entire audience.
The discourse was one worthy of the attention of all who
heard it&mdash;the sufferings of Jesus in and around Jerusalem&mdash;His
temptation and trial of toil and misery&mdash;His holy life&mdash;His
triumphant death and resurrection&mdash;His grand ascension
to the realms of the blessed, were eloquently delineated.
The certainty of death&mdash;the shortness of life&mdash;the never
ending of the life beyond the grave were theories eagerly
pressed for reception upon the minds of her hearers. Taking
all in all, the discourse was well delivered and spiced
with enough enthusiasm to produce good effect. But, Mr.
Editor, the idea of a woman canvassing the world in behalf
of the church is simply an incident so unusual that quite a
number of us here eagerly inquire, what has become of the
men? * * * *</p>

<p>Elizabeth R. Wheaton, for such is the name of our distinguished
visitor, related among other things, that she was
called and led by the God of Glory to go all over the world
and preach the gospel to the lost children of men, that the
prisons, saloons, dens of sin and pollution were the places
of her special care. The huts of the poor and outcast were
by her to be visited and that she did not ask for money,
that her Master had promised to provide all things for her
and did so daily.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Saw Mother Wheaton.</span></h4>

<p class="center">THE NOTED PRISON EVANGELIST VISITED THE COUNTY JAIL
PRISONERS TODAY.</p>

<p>A kindly faced, white-haired old lady walked into the
county jail this morning and asked permission to address
the prisoners. She was "Mother" Elizabeth Rider Wheaton,
the prison evangelist, who is known from coast to coast.
As soon as her identity was made known Turnkey Reynolds
and his corps of assistants did their utmost to assist the
generous old lady. She was shown through the building,
and then allowed to enter each ward.</p>

<p>From 11 o'clock until long after the noon hour she remained
with the unfortunates, visiting them separately and
then preaching to all. Tears were in the eyes of many of
these hardened criminals before she had finished.</p>

<p>"Mother" Wheaton was met at the jail entrance and
asked to explain her system of working. "It is all done by
faith," she said. "I have faith in God, and that is sufficient.
He will provide me with all that is necessary to carry on
this work."</p>

<p>"Under whose guidance do you work?" was asked.</p>

<p>"The Lord's, and His only," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But are you not employed by some religious sect?"</p>

<p>"No. I do this on my own responsibility, and for the
glory of God. For the past fifteen years this has been my
life's work. I go where I please and do as I please."</p>

<p>"How far have you traveled?"</p>

<p>"Thousands and thousands of miles. Last year I was
in Europe and have been all over America."</p>

<p>For the past forty years "Mother" Wheaton has been
a professed believer in Christianity. Fifteen years ago she
started in the work of visiting prisons, and has been in every
place of detention in any city of note. She is received with
the utmost courtesy both by the officials and the prisoners.
Many of the latter have met her at different places, and
most all the officials are acquainted with her and her work.&mdash;A

<h4><span class="smcap">The Prison Evangelist.</span></h4>

<p class="center">MRS. E. R. WHEATON DELIVERS AN ADDRESS AT THE PENITENTIARY
CHAPEL SUNDAY MORNING.</p>

<p>The service at the penitentiary chapel Sunday was made
memorable by the presence and discourse of Mrs. E. R.
Wheaton, the world-known prison evangelist. Chaplain
Winget conducted the services and offered the invocation
and in a few explanatory remarks introduced Mrs. Wheaton.
Mrs. Wheaton's hair is white as silver, but she still
retains her ever-youthful appearance and sprightly step.
She sang in an indescribably sweet, but powerful, voice
"Some Mother's Child." At the conclusion of the singing
Mrs. Wheaton preached a wonderful discourse. "I was
on my way to Jerusalem," said she, "and had gotten as far
as London, England, when the Lord turned me back to my
own country and to my suffering boys in prison; and I said
God bless my children, my boys, for I am their mother.</p>

<p>"Oh! how sad and discouraged many of you are, but if
you will believe in God and read your Bible you will be
comforted. How can any man have the heart not to believe
the Bible and rest his case upon the bosom of the good
Lord who died for us? I thank God that the good old-time
religion still lives. The devil, my children, causes you all
your sufferings and sorrows. Exchange him for Jesus.
He will keep you. Forgive your enemies and submit yourself
to the officers of the prison. You must obey&mdash;it is the
Lord's will. He has placed you here for his own purpose,
maybe for your soul's good and salvation. Jesus says,
'Come to me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you
rest.' Have faith. I am so sorry when some of you do
wrong for the innocent must suffer with the guilty and
society becomes stern with you. God bless you all."&mdash;Columbus,

<h4><span class="smcap">Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton Preaches to Unfortunates.</span></h4>

<p class="center">VISITS THE BRIDEWELL AND HEARS THE COMPLAINT OF ONE
OF THE CITY'S CHARGES.</p>

<p>"What's the use? What have I to hope for? Who cares
for me? Who'll help me? What can I do when my time
expires? Everybody's hand will be against me! A hopeless
drunkard is past redemption."</p>

<p>Tears came to the eyes of Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton
yesterday afternoon as she heard these words fall from the
lips of a dejected prisoner at the bridewell. The prison and
train evangelist whose work for fifteen years among convicts
had brought her many such questions, which she was
unable to answer to the satisfaction of the prisoners, spoke
to the wretched man in tender tones, and told him of the
consolation offered by religion.</p>

<p>"But," she said, turning to a reporter, "what can I do
in one conversation? It needs many. I'm going back to
Chicago next week, and I intend to devote considerable
time to every prison and house of refuge in the city. I
haven't done any work in the city since the anarchist execution."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton's methods of evangelizing are sometimes
dramatic. For instance, Mrs. Wheaton arrived in Chicago
from St. Louis on a Wabash train early yesterday morning.
Night before last, while the train was speeding along in
the darkness, the occupants of the reclining chair car were
startled.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried a voice in shrill tones. "We're coming
to a high bridge. Before we reach it we pass over a curve.
The rails may be all right, the bridge may be safe; but
who knows?"</p>

<p>The passengers turned around in their seats. They looked
frightened and appeared anxious to know whether there
was really an impending danger. They saw only a woman
whose face, softened by grief, bore lines of pain and care.
She was Mrs. Wheaton.</p>

<p>"But the Christian is not afraid to die," she continued.
"He welcomes death as a release from care and a blessing."</p>

<p>Then the evangelist preached a sermon, to which all
listened with attention.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Wheaton has visited every state in the
Union many times during her fifteen years of missionary
work, she has been in a sleeping car but once. Railroads
give her passes. She has no property, and, of course, can
collect no money from convicts, though occasionally she
receives a contribution on trains.</p>

<p>"The trouble of it all," said she after her talk with the
man in the bridewell, "is not in the prisons. It is after the
convicts get out. For that, humanity is to blame. Prisoners
have not much hope, and some of them accept religion
in a tentative sort of way.</p>

<p>"When they are released they are hounded by the police,
marked by all citizens as ostracized men, unable to get employment,
and, in fact, the second termers tell me they are
reduced almost to the necessity of choosing between starvation
and stealing. Those whose conversion is real do
neither, because no man need ever starve in this country,
but the weak go under and are brought back to jail. What
the world needs is more Christian charity. We should forgive,
as our Saviour did, seventy times seven."</p>

<p>In addition to her charm as a speaker, Mrs. Wheaton is
a singer of no mean ability. She is not a believer in men
who accept religion for the sake of business and put on a
sanctimonious air. The view that she takes of life meets
with favor among the convicts, and she sings a song called
"The Twin Ballots," which illustrates her opinion on the
temperance question. The song is about two rum votes that
sanctioned the license plan, "but one was cast by a cunning
brewer and one by a Sunday-school man."</p>

<p>The evangelist left last night for Pittsburg, but will return
next week. She said she wished to impress upon
people the fact that converted prisoners are not hypocrites,
although the guards often suspect insincerity and treat a
converted man worse than any other, because they think he
is seeking to curry favor.&mdash;A Chicago paper.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A Disgraceful Proceeding.</span></h4>

<p>Thursday afternoon, Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton, the noted
prison evangelist, accompanied by a sister, asked permission
from a policeman, which was granted, to hold a street meeting
for religious purposes.</p>

<p>After singing some hymns, which, from their superior
rendition, attracted a large crowd, Mrs. Wheaton, an elderly
lady who has devoted seven years of her time entirely
to prison evangelical work, began an earnest exhortation to
sinners. After preaching for a few minutes Officer C. came
up and said that the mayor had ordered him to put a stop
to the proceedings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton said she would do her duty without fear
of man and continued for a moment longer. Then the party
knelt on the snow and began to pray for the mayor and the
policeman. While they were praying the officer came up
closely followed by Mayor J., and roughly pushed Mrs.
Wheaton over. The mayor with fire in his eye as well as
his complexion, spoke in a very rude manner to the ladies,
practically endorsing the rough treatment already accorded
the party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton showed <cite>The Dispatch</cite> credentials from
very high sources and a very bulky bundle of railroad passes
which gave substantial evidence of the manner in which she
and her work are regarded elsewhere.</p>

<p>She has traveled over the United States and Mexico, and
parts of Europe, and it remained for a Leadville mayor to
break the record and treat her with indignity. She was
very much shocked and grieved and said she felt deeply
sorry for Leadville, which she had often heard spoken of
as a wicked city.</p>

<p><cite>The Dispatch</cite> is free to say that Mayor J. acted without
adequate provocation and displayed an unnecessary exercise
of authority. If the services had been prolonged to any
great extent he might have sent a request to have them discontinued,
but there was no occasion for any such arbitrary
exhibition of power as was made.</p>

<p>Far greater blockades with less meritorious objects have
existed without protest in Leadville. A medicine faker who
pays a few dollars license can yell and sing and make night
hideous for hours and it is all right, but a humble evangelical
missionary, whose sincerity and good intentions are not
doubted, however persons may differ concerning the methods,
is unceremoniously made to move on. If the authorities
displayed as much zeal in suppressing vice as they do in
shutting off missionaries, Leadville would be a model city.</p>

<p>The prison evangelists, after having been ordered off
Harrison avenue, visited both city and county jails, where
they were kindly received and permitted by the officers to
hold services among the prisoners. It is said that this is the
first religious service held in the Leadville jails.&mdash;Leadville,
Colo., Dispatch, March, 1891.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Disgraceful.</span></h4>

<p>Last night, when the ladies who have been conducting religious
services in the park, were preparing to close, some
miscreant in human form threw a small torpedo at them
and struck Mrs. Wheaton above the right eye. It did not
produce any serious injury, but was very painful at the
time, and may terminate worse than at first supposed. This
act evidently issued from some low, depraved fiend whom
the darkness of the hour shielded from justice. The ladies
departed from the city this morning, and the exact result
of the disgraceful episode cannot be learned. As soon as it
was done some man in the crowd offered $100 reward for
the identification of the party who did the dastardly trick,
but of course no one knew who the miscreant was except
he himself.&mdash;Jacksonville, Ill., paper, June 26, 1887.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Prison Evangelist.</span></h4>

<p>"Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, prison evangelist, Chicago,
Ill. Meet me in heaven. No home but heaven." This is
what is printed on the card of a remarkable woman who
visited the penitentiary and talked to the convicts at 11
o'clock on Sunday. This woman has been engaged in this
work for about nine years, and she has visited nearly every
prison and jail in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
She is the Moody of the convict world. She asks for no
money. She gives her services free, and trusts to Providence
for her support. "The Lord provides," she says.
She has held services in a different state or territorial prison
the past five Sundays, from Stillwater, Minn. (where Cole
Younger is confined and assists in and sometimes leads religious
services), to Salem, Oregon. Mrs. Wheaton also
visits reform schools. She is one of the chief advocates of
the reformatory system being adopted in some of the Eastern
prisons whereby convicts of different classes are graded
and kept separate, wear different uniforms, etc., and are
also let out on furloughs on trial or probation. Mrs.
Wheaton devotes her whole time to prison work. She certainly
accomplishes some good from all this effort. She was
a Methodist before taking up this life work, but now holds
to no sect.&mdash;Salem, Oregon, paper, Nov. 16, 1891.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A Noble Work.</span></h4>

<p>Among the evangelistic workers who go out among the
people seeking the low and degraded and trying to lift them
up to be better men and women, Elizabeth R. Wheaton is
one of the chosen few who is well adapted to this work.
She asks no pay and receives none, but with noble purpose
and with heart and mind fully in the work which has been
given her, she travels from Maine to California and from
British Columbia to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Her work is chiefly among the state prisons, county jails
and reform schools. Here she meets a class of people
schooled in vice and who have been kept face to face with
the different evils all their lives; these are the people whom
she seeks to save.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton has just returned from a successful trip
through Mexico and the South and is now on her way to
Walla Walla, Portland and British Columbia. She stopped
off here to visit our penitentiary and jail. Through the
kindness of the warden she held a song service last Sunday
at the State penitentiary, and the amount of good which she
did was shown by the eager attention of the convicts, and
the tear-stained faces of some who, when the good old-fashioned
hymns were sung, thought of their far-away
homes and mothers. Sunday evening she held services at
the jail and on the street, both of which were much appreciated.&mdash;Unidentified.</p>

<p class="center">THE INMATES OF ATLANTA'S PRISONS HEARD PREACHING
YESTERDAY.</p>

<p>The prisoners at police headquarters, at the jail and at
the city stockade listened to the gospel of Christ yesterday.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, the famous prison evangelist,
of Washington, held services at all these places.
Her talks were of the most interesting character and evidently
made deep impressions upon her hearers.</p>

<p>The service at the jail was held in the morning, the one
at the stockade in the afternoon, and the one at the police
station at night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton is perhaps the most famous evangelist of
her kind in the country. She makes a specialty of this work
and follows it closely week after week. She has preached
to convicts and prisoners in every state in the Union, frequently
traveling as far as 700 miles between Sundays in
order to make an appointment. She has letters of introduction
from the governors of many states, and free passes on
railroads. She is here with the Christian Workers, but is
not a delegate.&mdash;Atlanta, Ga., paper, Nov. 14, 1893.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prison Evangelists.</span></h4>

<p class="center">THE INMATES OF THE COUNTY JAIL TREATED TO A SERMON.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, the prison evangelist, who
has been traveling over the United States for ten years past,
and two sisters from Washington, D. C., and Kansas City,
arrived in the city this morning and held religious service
in the county jail. The twenty-four inmates of the bastile
were much pleased with the service.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton and her companions held services yesterday
at the prison at Lansing, Kan., where 900 convicts are
confined. Lately they have come from the convict camp of
South Carolina and Mrs. Wheaton can tell many tales of the
sufferings endured by the prisoners there.&mdash;Unidentified.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The News at Leavenworth.</span></h4>

<p class="center">MOTHER WHEATON, PRISON EVANGELIST, VISITS THE UNITED
STATES PRISON.</p>

<p>Religious services at the federal penitentiary at Fort
Leavenworth yesterday were somewhat out of the usual
order. Mother Wheaton, the prison evangelist, late of Washington,
D. C., now of Iowa, preached to the convicts at the
morning hour. Her address was a most effective one and
men all through the audience were moved to tears. At the
close of the service she stood at the chapel door and shook
the hand of each prisoner as he went out.</p>

<p>Her head is white with age, yet she has visited the prisons
of the United States and many in Europe, bearing messages
of hope and cheer to the condemned. She is not alone a
woman of ready speech, but is a sweet singer as well. Her
life is dedicated to her work, and many is the unfortunate
who has cause to bless the visit of Mother Wheaton. Mrs.
T., of this city, accompanied her to the prison.&mdash;Leavenworth,
Kan., paper.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Jail Service.</span></h4>

<p>The inmates of the county jail were honored yesterday
by a visit from that well known prison evangelist, Elizabeth
Rider Wheaton, who was accompanied by a Mrs. S.,
of Kansas. Mrs. Wheaton conducted religious services and
her talk had a deep effect upon murderer Williamson, the
old man being visibly moved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton has made the visiting of prisons, condemned
men and fallen women her life work, and in the
course of her travels during the past seven years has visited
Europe, the British provinces, Mexico and the United
States. As an example of her earnest efforts it may be
mentioned that during the past thirteen Sundays she has
visited and held services in fourteen different state penitentiaries.
Mrs. Wheaton is a lady of striking appearance.
She has a motherly countenance and a magnetism which attracts
the closest attention to what she says. Her discourse
yesterday was eloquent, yet at times plain and pointed to
severity. Mrs. Wheaton left yesterday on the afternoon
train for the Pacific coast.&mdash;Sedalia, Mo., paper, November,
1891.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Preached To Convicts.</span></h4>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, the noted evangelist, and
Mrs. Perry, who are engaged in preaching and working
among the prisons, visited the Virginia penitentiary yesterday
and held services in each chapel. Their exhortations
and singing were of a high order and produced a powerful
effect among the prisoners. Many of them made a profession
of faith. Mrs. Wheaton has preached in most of the
penitentiaries of the United States. She has also traveled
and preached in Canada and Mexico as well as in the Old
World. The ladies are being entertained by Superintendent
Lynn and will remain in the city several days.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Police Station Services.</span></h4>

<p class="center">MRS. ELIZABETH RIDER WHEATON TALKS TO THE MEMBERS
OF THE FORCE.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, the evangelist, was at the
police station last night at roll call and held a short service
for the benefit of the members of the police force. She delivered
an interesting address to the officers and offered a
prayer, after which she led them in a song. The officers
expressed themselves as having been greatly benefited by the
service, and the evangelist was invited to call again.&mdash;Unidentified.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Services at the Workhouse.</span></h4>

<p>"Mother" Wheaton, the prison evangelist, who was mentioned
last Monday as holding meetings in Island Park the
day before, called at the police station this morning to ask
permission to talk and sing to the prisoners confined in the
workhouse. The permission was granted. The lady has
traveled extensively in her evangelistic work, making flying
trips all over the United States especially. Within the last
thirty days she has talked to prisoners at Walla Walla, Tacoma
and in other northwestern cities. While in this
city she is the guest of her sister, Mrs. Huffman, of Kenwood.&mdash;Elkhart
(Ind.) Paper.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A Strange Life of Devotion in Neglected Fields.</span></h4>

<p>The prisoners in the Dade coal mines made the acquaintance
yesterday of two women&mdash;two religious tramps, if
you please, using the word literally&mdash;whose adventures in
evangelizing are probably without parallel.</p>

<p>They are Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, the famous
prison evangelist, and her temporary assistant, Mrs. P.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton has for ten years been preaching in
prisons, convict camps, houses of ill-fame and the like, not
only in the United States, but in Canada, Mexico and
Europe. One, upon meeting her, would naturally be very
uncertain as to where one might or might not meet next this
spirit-led traveler&mdash;recognizing which uncertainty, perhaps,
she has printed upon her cards, in lieu of an earthly address:</p>

<p>"Meet me in heaven."</p>

<p>The two women visited the jail Thursday, becoming very
much interested in the case of P. S., it seems, on account of
his relationship to Rev. S. J. Mrs. Wheaton spoke of P.
as a "beautiful black-eyed young married man."</p>

<p>They took part in the Christian alliance meeting Friday
afternoon at 51 James street, at which over thirty people
were present.</p>

<p>They will hold special services at the coal mine convict
camps to-day, returning to Atlanta within a few days. They
carry this letter&mdash;an "open sesame" to every prison and
camp in Georgia:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Atlanta, Ga., June 30.&mdash;To the captain in charge of convict
camps in Georgia: I desire that each of you extend to these ladies,
Mrs. Wheaton and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, any courtesies possible during their
stay with you; that they may be given opportunities to talk to the
men and women in your charge. I will particularly appreciate any
kindness shown them. The governor also requests that they be shown
courtesies."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is signed by George H. Jones, the principal keeper.
"Courtesies," by the way, is spelled "curtisys" in the letter,
but it's official, and "it goes."</p>

<p>Return to Atlanta&mdash;that is to say they will return unless
the spirit moves Mrs. Wheaton to go on from Chattanooga
to St. Louis, or Montreal, or Berlin, or somewhere else.</p>

<p>Coming to Atlanta on the Richmond and Danville, Mrs.
Wheaton was moved to hold services in the smoking car.
Just as the train was rolling out of Calhoun, S. C., Mrs.
Wheaton spied some convicts at work.</p>

<p>Convicts!</p>

<p>Instantly she decided to stop over. She and Mrs. P.
bundled up their wraps and packages and got off
after the train had started. They knew nobody there.
They had no money&mdash;that is, "not enough to count." Somehow
or other they got transportation to and from the station,
and supper, and to other works, and arranged a meeting.
It was a glorious meeting, they say.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton's faith&mdash;and railroad passes, she adds
laughingly&mdash;have kept her going for ten years.</p>

<p>She traveled 5,000 miles between one Sunday and the
second Sunday afterwards, collecting only fifty cents on the
way.</p>

<p>The Lord will provide, she knows.</p>

<p>The faith that removes mountains is here in reality.</p>

<p>Always on the go&mdash;never stopping but a day or two in
one place&mdash;meeting men to be hanged the next day&mdash;praying
with fallen women&mdash;interceding with governors for
human life&mdash;blindly following, without regard to time or
distance, the mysterious dictates of what she calls "the
Spirit."</p>

<p>She is so well known now throughout the United States&mdash;having
been engaged in this work for ten years&mdash;that she
is rarely refused a railroad pass. She has letters of commendation
from governors and prison authorities. * * *</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton's services in the jails and convict camps
are unique, remarkable for their fervency and impromptu
character. Singing plays an important part. * * *</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton has made many wonderful conversions
in the slums and prisons, and has seen many famous criminals
in their last hours.</p>

<p>She is the guest in Atlanta of Mrs. J. H. Murphy, at 267
East Cain street.&mdash;Atlanta (Ga.) Herald, July 2, 1893.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Preaching on the Streets.</span></h4>

<p>Thursday evening the sound of an alto voice singing a
familiar hymn on Sandy street, near Murphy's corner, soon
gathered a crowd, when a lady, whose hair was beginning
to silver with gray, mounted a box and preached to the
mixed assemblage a sermon, after which the singing was
resumed, the meeting concluding with a fervent and earnest
prayer. A reporter called at the hotel and learned that
the lady was Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton, a prison evangelist.
Heretofore she has had a "sister" to travel with
her. She showed the reporter stacks of letters from the
wardens of various state penitentiaries, commending her,
and praising the work she has done in this specialty. She
has preserved files of newspaper criticisms, many of which
are complimentary of the work she has done, and some
from the secular press making light of her work.</p>

<p>That she is in earnest no one who considers that she has
given up home and friends and roamed all over the United
States, Canada, Mexico and in part of Europe to preach to
unappreciative street crowds, prison convicts, etc., can doubt.
And whatever may be said of the method, as was illustrated
on the streets here last night, there are many reached with
a sermon that have not perhaps heard one for months.&mdash;Unidentified.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prayer Service in Jail.</span></h4>

<p>Through the efforts of Mrs. E. R. Wheaton, the prison
evangelist, the county jail was turned into a house of prayer
last evening, and for an hour or more the walls of the building
resounded with the shouts of prayer and praise of this
earnest woman.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Mrs. Wheaton called on Gregory,
the horsethief and desperado, and was the first to bring to
the surface in his case any signs of remorse or sentiment
of any kind. When the gray-haired and motherly woman
took the hand of the confessed thief and ex-convict in hers
and prayed for him great tears flowed down his cheeks
and he was affected as none of the other prisoners had
been. Gregory said he had known Mrs. Wheaton for fourteen
years. She does not remember him, but says it is not
unlikely that he has seen her if he has been in the several
prisons in which it is said he has served time, as she has
been visiting them all off and on in her work for a great
many years.&mdash;Council Bluffs, Iowa, Nonpareil, Jan. 19,

<p class="center">THEIR WORK IS IN PRISONS.</p>

<p class="center">Party of Evangelists Pay a Visit to the County Jail.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, the prison evangelist,
was in Butte for a short time yesterday on her way west,
and between trains conducted services in the corridor of
the county jail.</p>

<p>In addition to being an earnest exhorter, Mrs. Wheaton,
despite the fact that she is well advanced in years, is the
possessor of a fine voice. When she sings in a prison the
most hardened criminals never fail to listen to her with
great respect. During the services in the jail yesterday
clerks and court officers ceased from their duties and with
the people who had business in the building, blocked the
passage ways leading to the jail to listen to her. The
other members of the party also delivered exhortations and
joined in the singing. The farewell hymn, given in a
clear soprano voice by Mrs. Wheaton, "God be with you
till we meet again," was especially sweet. Whether the
services made any lasting impression on the men behind
the bars cannot be known, but the fact remains that when
they were over there was an unusual quiet in the jail and
the air seemed more wholesome. From Butte she went to
Deer Lodge to visit the penitentiary.&mdash;Butte, Montana,
paper, 1897.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Street Services.</span></h4>

<p>On Wednesday and Thursday our town was visited by
two lady missionaries or preachers of the gospel. They
were perfect strangers here and claimed that their mission
was to try to open the eyes of sinful people and beg them
to come to Christ. They sang, prayed and preached upon
the streets, and at the colored church, having been refused
the use of some of the white churches. We know not whom
these persons are, or from where they came, but we do
know that they were very lady-like in their conduct, and
there was a terrible earnestness about their work. They
preached pure gospel in the most Christ-like manner that
it was ever our privilege to hear&mdash;down upon their knees
in the streets, surrounded by a motley multitude, begging
God in a most pleading and fervent manner to save the sinners
of this place, and singing glorious praises to Him on
this beautiful day of national thanksgiving, was a spectacle
that we had never expected to witness. Whether or not
this is proper in the eyes of the world we cannot say, but
if their work is earnest as it seems, they will be rewarded
in heaven.&mdash;Unidentified.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">For Prisoners.</span></h4>

<p class="center">TOUCHING SCENES IN BANGOR JAIL.&mdash;GOOD DEEDS THAT
SHINE IN MORAL DARKNESS.</p>

<p>Never were gospel hymns&mdash;words of comfort set to
hopeful music, sang more sweetly and earnestly, or with
better effect than were the songs of a plainly dressed woman
of tranquil face and gentle manner in the echoing corridors
of Bangor jail Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>This woman was Mrs. Elizabeth Rider Wheaton whose
home is everywhere in earth's saddest ways. She is a
prison evangelist and her card bears the simple admonition:
"Prepare to Meet Thy God."</p>

<p>She came lately to Maine, and arrived in Bangor Tuesday
noon from Belfast. On the train Mrs. Wheaton talked
of Christian things, and she sang hymns to the passengers&mdash;"Throw
Out the Life Line" and other well-remembered
songs&mdash;in a way that reached the hearts of all. When
she got here she went for a few minutes to a low-priced
hotel, and thence to the county jail. The officials received
her kindly, and the prisoners, who, after their dinner of
soup, had gone into the work shop, were brought in to
hear some of the kindest words and most touching songs
that they had listened to for many a day.</p>

<p>Those innocent and comfortable Christians who have
only heard hymns sung in churches or chapels to well-dressed
and presumably good people can have no idea of
the sweetly weird effect of gospel melodies swelling in the
vast and dismal spaces of a jail, while gathered around are
the very lost sheep that the shepherds of churches are commanded
to find. It is a reproachful picture from the realism
of blasted lives&mdash;a startling, chilling glimpse of the
depth of wretchedness, lighted up by a feeble ray from the
goodness that yet survives amid it all.</p>

<p>Some old and hardened habitues of jails mock and sneer
at the voices raised in their behalf and scoff at the hands
held out to lift them up, but most men, in jail or out, treat
women like this with silent respect. It was so in the jail
Tuesday.</p>

<p>When the men had filed out to the broom shop again
Mrs. Wheaton went to a cell occupied by two elderly
women and talked and sang to them. The women, whose
wickedness all lay in drink, seemed pleased and affected.
They thought this evangelist the kindest they had ever
met.</p>

<p>The evangelist may hold some meetings here before she
leaves. She was much pleased with her reception in Bangor,
and would like to remain a few days. She has letters
of recommendation from the governors of several states and
from the officials of numerous prisons. She belongs to no
army or organization, but travels independently, doing
what good she can.&mdash;Bangor, Me., paper.</p>

A VISIT.</p>

<p>Elizabeth R. Wheaton, the well-known prison evangelist,
arrived in the city Monday evening and yesterday visited
the county and city jails, where she talked and prayed with
the poor unfortunates confined therein. * * * More
than one poor fellow has blessed the short hour when her
motherly presence and sweetly spoken words of comfort
have made his fate seem easier to bear, while repentant tears
have filled the eyes of many a hardened criminal when
listening to her pleadings. She approaches the most degraded
with a familiar motherly air, which at once wins
their most profound respect and reverence. * * *</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton expects to leave today for Pueblo where
she will be joined by a sister in the work, when they will
continue their journey together. She spoke very highly of
the courteous treatment received from the officers and of
the cleanly condition of the jails.&mdash;Daily Advertiser, Trinidad,

<h4><span class="smcap">Visit from Missionaries.</span></h4>

<p>Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, better known as "Mother
Wheaton," the prison evangelist, and Mrs. Elizabeth Taylor,
of Tabor, Iowa, called at the Institution Thursday afternoon
on a missionary errand. Mother Wheaton has spent
fifteen years in evangelical work among the inmates of
the various prisons throughout the United States. Her
friends among the convicts are numbered by the thousands.
We so rarely meet with any one who really sympathizes
with us in our misfortune that when these two
good women come inside the walls for no other purpose
but to encourage us to do better and give assurance of their
love and good wishes, we are made to feel that we are still
human and may hope for a better day. By reason of the
chapel building undergoing repairs, it was impossible for
them to meet many of the boys or hold services.&mdash;A Prison
Paper.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A Remarkable Scene.</span></h4>

<p class="center">A WORK OF LOVE BY AN ELDERLY LADY.&mdash;THE SCENERY OF
OAK CLIFF.</p>

<p>Last night the moon shed its full luster slightly dimmed
by thin clouds.</p>

<p>The crowd stood by a negro church at the point of the
hill, just above the creek banks at their intersection. The
view from the top of the hill was enchanting.</p>

<p>The lady passed the crowd and stopped in the moonshine
in front of the church. Here she was joined by a party of
three other ladies and two men, whom she had preceded
a little. Two of the ladies held babies in their arms.</p>

<p>In a strong and beautiful alto voice a song burst forth
from the lips of the elderly lady: "I Will Tell the Wondrous
Story of the Christ Who Died for Me." Her companions
joined her in the song and the refrain echoed far
and near over the hillsides: "Of the Christ who died for
me."</p>

<p>The inhabitants heard it.</p>

<p>But this is the part of Oak Cliff inhabited by negroes.
In response they swarmed out as would have done the
followers to the signal of Roderick Dhu.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the church was filled and a few white people
were among the audience drawn thither by the song.</p>

<p>The services were begun with prayer by the elderly
lady, whose hair, when she had removed her bonnet, shone
silvery gray. It was nothing out of the usual order of
prayers except that it was accompanied with unusual fervor
and simplicity being adapted to the circumstances. If
any had assembled through curiosity she prayed that their
hearts would be turned.</p>

<p>Then came other singing and prayer by a good colored
sister named Cynthia Maria, who wore a white bonnet, and
chanted her words, making the scene a wierd one.</p>

<p>Then the elderly lady rendered in beautiful solo, "Oh
Christ, I am lost forever. I am to confront an angry God,"
from which she began her discourse, pleading to her colored
hearers to open their hearts that night. She said she
had the old time religion. This announcement was greeted
with religious laughter from the congregation. The women
had not been allowed to preach and she thought that there
were souls in perdition on this account. People said that
she had no business there last night. She had business in
glory and was going to help crown Christ the Lord of
Lords. For seven years she had been a pilgrim and had
traveled from ocean to ocean and from state to state without
receiving a salary or taking up a cent. There was the
same God with her who was with Daniel in the lions' den,
and who led the Children of Israel through the Red Sea.
She had seen sore trouble, but there were few who knew
it. She had the old-time religion, and that was what her
hearers needed. She forsook home and country to go and
preach the gospel to convicts and fallen women and most
of her friends had forsaken her for this. She used to be
proud. She had given up pride and given up style. She
was glad that God had called the meeting. She did not
know that she was to preach there until yesterday afternoon
when someone informed her that the colored people
wanted her to preach. She had visited the county jail
last Sunday and prayed and sang with the prisoners. Some
of them had forgotten about the old-time religion and requested
her to sing the song having that title.</p>

<p>Here the woman began that song joined by the congregation,
a large number of whom got happy. It required
the efforts of several of the colored portion of the congregation
to hold down one sister who wore a straw hat and
got shouting happy and paid no attention to her surroundings.</p>

<p>After a short talk by Rev. B., colored, the congregation
was dismissed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">At the Colored Church.</span></h4>

<p class="center">MRS. ELIZABETH R. WHEATON LECTURES ON THE IMPORTANCE
OF CONVERSION&mdash;SHE SAYS THE HARDEST PEOPLE
TO CONVERT ARE PREACHERS.</p>

<p>As a News reporter and a News special artist, guided
by a friendly star, wended their muddy way last night to
the little negro church upon the hill at Oak Cliff, they
overtook two solemn looking figures going up an incline.
One of them proved to be the famous prison evangelist,
Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton. This lady turned her face to
the News emissaries and inquired in a sweet silvery tone:</p>

<p>"Going to church, brothers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Oh, God bless you, brothers, come on."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the church was reached. The penitent
sister with the white bonnet, who was inspired on
the previous night and started to shouting, had already arrived,
as also had the good sister who called on the baseball
man to run from the devil. What influence drives
those simple worshipers to shouting and to imitate flying,
is a question for the psychologists. Certain it is that the
little and the great are linked together in this life and
perhaps the present is linked to the future. Quien sabe.
The meeting last night was free from shouting, but fervid
with emotion. On arriving in front of the church Mrs.
Wheaton turned her face to the pale moon, which had
sailed high in the heavens, and sang "Sweet are the tidings
that greet the pilgrims' ear." As she sung she gesticulated
and her gray hair shone like silver. She had not gone
beyond the third line of the said stirring hymn before the
penitents inside of the church started to sing a hymn and
then the scene was as impressive as the music was discordant.
The hymns over, Mrs. Wheaton knelt on the wet
ground and prayed while Deacon Banks did likewise inside
of the church. The interjections were so many that
he was forced to use short sentences.</p>

<p>"Come one, come all, while it is day."</p>

<p>"O, yes, Lord, we come, we'se a'comin'."</p>

<p>"O Lord, put the move on and call us away."</p>

<p>"O, yes, good Lord, we come."</p>

<p>At this point Mrs. Wheaton entered and ascended the
low pulpit from which, for a moment, she silently surveyed
the assembled multitude of black faces. She was
wreathed in smiles, looking like the sun of righteousness
shining on a dark, murky cloud of suffering humanity.</p>

<p>"God grant," she observed, "that nobody goes down to
the lake of fire." "God grant it, ma-a-a-m." "Oh-oh-bo-bo."
"Nobody knows de trouble I see," and any number of exclamations
each giving vent to an exclamation suited to
the feelings of the penitent. The mention of fire seemed
to cause a panic among the good colored people with a
single exception. He was a dude who did not deign to
sit down, but stood near the door seemingly watching the
females. Only once did he drop on his knees and that was
when he discovered the News artist in the act of tracing
his outlines on the flyleaf of a prayer book.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton then lectured upon the importance of
conversion. As she proceeded, describing the fate of convicts
and other sufferers, the iron of the ways of the world
seemed to enter her soul and she wept. Nobody who hears
her doubts her sincerity. She does not criticise the fallen;
she weeps for them. The folks in heaven do the same.
Only once last night did she criticise, and she said she did
it for a benevolent purpose, and as she did it (as indeed
throughout her entire remarks) the colored woman with
the man's straw hat interlarded her remarks with her own
opinions rendered in a whanging, chanting voice. This
was how it ran: "The churches have got away from the
old land marks [yes, ma'am; deed they has, ma'am]. It
is hard, hard work to reach preachers [yes, ma'am; yes,
ma'am]. The big white preachers and the colored preachers
are nearly just as bad [O Lord, yes; good Lord ye-e-s,
ma'am.] They put on plug hats, jewelry and the trickery
of the devil. If preachers would do their duty I would
not have to visit the penitentiaries. Oh, the hardest work
I have is to preach to preachers. [Dat's so, ma'am; dat's
so!] How many of you are living in lasciviousness, the
sin that's hidden but that God sees? It is going on in the
churches among some of the preachers. [Ah, yes, ma'am:
good Lord! Deed'n 'tis, ma'am]. Ah! I have got to go to
judgment and I will tell you the truth. There are other
sins, but I do not want to mention them because I feel that
you know all about them; but they won't be hidden and
unless you have a pure spirit and a clean heart you can
never see the face of God. Now say you will sin no more.
[Several voices in alto: A-a-a-men.] These white
churches," proceeded Mrs. Wheaton, "are a little worse
than the colored churches, for there is a little Holy Ghost
left in the colored churches. Oh, how many of those white
church members are going down to hell! It grieves me
to think of it. I'm going to meet some of you in glory.
After I get there the first ones I want to see crowned are
the poor convicts who have been murdered on the scaffold
after they had turned their faces to God, and those poor
convicts who have suffered, oh, you know not how much,
how much, without human sympathy."</p>

<p>At this point a sad-looking man volunteered a hymn,
during the singing of which much of Mrs. Wheaton's remarks
were drowned. Mrs. Wheaton resumed: "It troubles
my heart to see the people drifting down, down to hell. I
feel like getting down to the foot of the cross and crying
mercy. For the attractions of this world I have no use;
I have no use for newspaper puffs. [They's no good,
ma'am: yes, ma'am.]"</p>

<p>The way in which the penitents chimed in as Mrs.
Wheaton proceeded rendered it impossible to report her
fully. The best that could be done was to catch sentences
on the fly. The stronger she appeared to her colored listeners
to seek for mercy the longer they sought it. Their
bodies were moved by their souls. Some swayed from
side to side; others placed their faces on their hands and
wept; others wrung their hands, and there was weeping and
wailing.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs at the conclusion of the address.
Just then Deacon Banks started a hymn and a few
others drifted off into different familiar hymns, so that
the music was varied. It was a spontaneous outburst of
songs of praise from away down in the bottom of afflicted
hearts which pays no attention to the measures of
music. The singing was awful. One female screeched
and no two voices were in harmony.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the hymn a deacon kneeling by a
chair prayed, striking the chair with his fists while a hundred
voices accompanied him. It was impossible to follow
him throughout, but among other things he said: "I know
that hell is broad and eternity too long. Oh King, King,
Lord have mercy on us. Guide us by the still water's side
and give us new pastures. Bless this congregation in the
hollow of thy hand, amen."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton informed the News reporter that she will
not go to Galveston.&mdash;Dallas News.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prison Worker Visits Tacoma.</span></h4>

<p class="center">"MOTHER" WHEATON CALLS AT COUNTY JAIL AND FEDERAL
PENITENTIARY.&mdash;KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD.&mdash;TWENTY-ONE
YEARS OF HER LIFE DEVOTED
TO LABOR AMONG UNFORTUNATES
OF MANY NATIONS.</p>

<p>"I trust in God and the railroad men."</p>

<p>This is the explanation of her ability to carry on her
work, expressed by "Mother" Wheaton, the prison evangelist,
who has an international reputation for her work in
the penitentiaries of the United States, Canada, Mexico
and Europe. Mother Wheaton is in Tacoma carrying on
her work among prisoners, work that has taken her into
every penitentiary in the United States and Canada. For
over twenty-one years she has carried the gospel to the
men in stripes and to those who wear the broad arrow of
England's displeasure, and it is Mother Wheaton's boast
that during all that time she has never asked for a contribution
or received a cent of salary.</p>

<p>Mother Wheaton came to Tacoma from her headquarters
in Tabor, Ia., accompanying Miss Grace Yarrette, a
young woman who is going as a missionary to India.</p>


<h4>MANY YEARS IN PRISON WORK.</h4>

<p>There is no woman in the world, and perhaps no man,
who has had the prison experience of Mother Wheaton.
The last twenty years of her life have virtually been spent
inside prison walls, and there is not many in the country
in which she is not a familiar figure. Long terms and lifers
all over the land know her. Frequently she inquires for
some prisoner whom death or the leniency of the law has
released, whom she has not seen or heard of for years.</p>

<p>Dressed in a soft gray suit, with a gray bonnet, Mother
Wheaton's appearance is distinctly motherly, and her smile
the personification of kindness and tenderness further bears
out the "Mother" by which she is known to thousands of
unfortunates. She is the guest of Mrs. Ellen M. Bates,
1211 North Prospect street. She is at work from the time
she arises in the morning until services are over in the
evening. While her principal work is in the prisons and
penitentiaries she takes part in evangelical and religious
work and finds time to visit rescue homes where her advice
is eagerly sought.</p>


<h4>MANY EXPERIENCES.</h4>

<p>"Experiences?" Mother Wheaton exclaimed, when asked
if her life had not been productive of many events out of
the ordinary run. "Experiences, why I have had so many
and such varied experiences that they are all a jumble in
my head. I have been in nearly every prison in the land.
I have consoled men who were but a few feet from the
gallows and I have held the hand of those unfortunates as
they sank into their last sleep in a cheerless prison hospital.</p>

<p>"I have seen sights that made my blood run cold and then
I have had the joy of seeing the word of God prevail and
the most case-hardened sinners the human mind could conceive
of have reformed before me. It has been a curious
mixture of sunshine and shadows, but after twenty-one
years I think I can say that the sunshine has predominated.
I put my trust in God for my work and I trust the railroad
men for transportation, and between the two I believe I
have been fairly successful."</p>


<h4>ONCE TAKEN FOR CARRIE NATION.</h4>

<p>"I have spent nights in the toughest slums of New York,
Chicago and St. Louis, places where men by force of habit
always carry their hand near their hip pocket, and I have
not always been welcomed. Sometimes I have been roughly
handled, yes, indeed. Why, one time I was mistaken for
Carrie Nation. Of course I don't look like Carrie Nation,
and I would never think of adopting smashing methods. I
was holding services in San Pedro, California, one night,
and went into a saloon. There were two bright looking
young men standing at the bar and I asked them to come
with me. The owner of the saloon was sitting at a faro
table in the back end of the saloon, and as soon as he
caught sight of me he rushed at me and literally threw me
out into the street.</p>

<p>"When he learned afterwards who I was he was very
sorry and avowed that he would never have treated me
in that manner had he not thought that I was Carrie Nation
and that I had a hatchet to chop up his expensive bar
fixtures."</p>


<h4>OPPOSES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.</h4>

<p>"As sad an experience as I ever had in my life was my
effort to save the life of a young man who was condemned
to hang in Colorado. I heard of the case through the
young man's mother, who was heart-broken. I interceded
with Governor Peabody and secured a reprieve for a year,
and when Governor McDonald took office he fixed the date
for the death of the young man. I tried to save him the
second time, but public sentiment demanded his death. I
don't believe in capital punishment. I have seen how a
man can be punished in prison and I don't believe in taking
a life to avenge a life, for stripped of all the specious arguments
which surround capital punishment, it simmers
down to nothing more than revenge."</p>


<h4>ESTABLISHES NEW RECORD.</h4>

<p>"I think I established a prison visiting record upon one
trip. I visited five penitentiaries in as many states in a
week. I started at Deer Lodge, Montana; from there I
went to Boise, Idaho; then to Rawlins, Wyo.; then to Salt
Lake City, and from Salt Lake City to Lincoln, Nebraska,
all of which I call pretty fast traveling. I hold meetings on
the train, in depots, at water tanks, any place I can gather
a little knot of people together, and I could tell of some
queer conversions in out of the way places, the last places
in the world where you would expect the seed to sprout
and bear fruit.</p>

<p>"I was over to the federal prison on McNeil's Island
Saturday, and this morning I went to the county hospital.
This afternoon I called at the county jail. I will be here a
day or so longer and then must start East, as I have work
to do in New York City. You see I will have to stop at
the prisons on the way back and I have to make allowances
for delays."</p>

<p>Mother Wheaton has become interested in Grace Russell,
the young woman in the county jail, who is addicted to the
use of morphine. Mother Wheaton will try to secure a
place for her in some home.&mdash;Tacoma, Washington, paper
of July 31, 1905.</p>

<p>I give the following extract from a Baltimore paper
published while I was there attending the Convocation of
Prayer in that city, January, 1903:</p>


<p class="center">SPIRITUAL ADVISER OF FAMOUS CRIMINALS.</p>

<p class="center"><small>WORK OF "MOTHER" WHEATON IN PRISONS ALL OVER THE LAND.</small></p>

<p>For twenty years Mrs. Wheaton has been traveling throughout the
United States, Europe, Canada and Mexico, working among prisoners
in hundreds of prisons and penitentiaries. On a number of occasions
she has converted criminals under death sentence. She has
preached in the Maryland Penitentiary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheaton came to Baltimore direct from Ohio, where she had
been holding prayer in the cells of the state prison with eight men
condemned to die. She was in San Francisco a number of years
ago when Alexander Goldenson killed his sweetheart, Mamie Kelly,
and after Goldenson had been tried, convicted and sentenced to death
"Mother" Wheaton prayed with him for forty days. The day of the
execution, September 14, 1888, he was converted through her instrumentality,
and just before walking to the gallows she tied her silk
handkerchief about the condemned man's neck.</p>


<h4>IS NOT A STRANGER.</h4>

<p class="center">OLD-TIMERS AT COUNTY JAIL GREET MRS. WHEATON AS
LONG-TIME FRIEND.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth R. Wheaton, of Tabor, Ia., famous in this
and other countries as a worker among the inmates of
jails and penitentiaries, yesterday morning went to the
county jail and prayed and sang hymns with the prisoners
in the tanks.</p>

<p>Although her time was very much circumscribed, Mrs.
Wheaton shook hands with most of the prisoners, many
of whom had heard of her, and some of whom had met
her in other prisons. John King, awaiting his transportation
to Walla Walla, and one of the most admittedly professional
criminals in the jail, stated that he had met
"Mother Wheaton" several times before, both at Salem
and at Walla Walla.</p>

<p>Both he and J. H. Le Roy, another old-timer, had many
anecdotes to tell of her kindnesses in past years.&mdash;Paper of
August 9, 1905.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Prisoners on Bended Knee.</span></h4>

<p class="center">INMATES OF COUNTY JAIL BOW IN PRAYER WITH MOTHER
WHEATON.</p>

<p>On bended knees and with low bowed heads nine prisoners
at the county jail reverently followed a prayer addressed
to the throne of grace in their behalf yesterday by
Mother Wheaton, the noted prison evangelist. Under the
remarkable influence of the woman who came among them
as a messenger of soul-saving, every rough instinct of the
men was quelled and every scoffing word hushed on their
lips. No more devout prayer meeting was ever held in a
sanctuary than that which took place in the jail corridor.</p>

<p>Mother Wheaton and a younger woman called upon the
prisoners and sang a song such as the men might have heard
their mothers or sisters sing in the long ago, when their feet
had not strayed from youthful paths of innocence. If there
was any inclination to ridicule or make light of the service
at the start, it was entirely subdued inside of five minutes.
Mother Wheaton talked to the men and told of the work
she has been doing for twenty years among the inmates of
jails and penitentiaries. She declared that she and her
assistant wanted to help save them.</p>

<p>There was no hesitation whatever when Mother Wheaton
asked the prisoners to get down on their knees. One and
all, the nine assumed the attitude of humble submission to
the deity and remained in that position until their patroness
had finished her petition for the pardoning of their sins.
Some of the men were seen to blink significantly and wipe
their eyes with handkerchiefs. When the prayer was done
and another hymn rendered, the men joining in, hands were
shaken all around before the visitors departed.</p>

<p>Mother Wheaton has been coming to the Council Bluffs
jail for several years. She was in the city on her way from
Nevada to Wisconsin.&mdash;<cite>Council Bluffs Paper.</cite></p>

<p class="left50">&mdash;<em>Sel.</em></p>

<p>The dear Lord wants workers, both men and women,
whom He can trust in every line of Christian work, and
what do Christians most need in order to be successful soul-winners
for God?</p>

<p>First of all, it is to be born of the Spirit; then to be filled
with the Holy Spirit, whereby we are sealed unto God.
Then the fruits of the Spirit will be manifest in our lives.
Of course, we should not presume to go out as mission
workers without a divine call from God.</p>

<p>The first thing, then, is to know God and then to know
ourselves as utterly helpless without the cleansing power
of the blood of Christ on our own souls. Then the especial
anointing for service in the vineyard of the Lord. If to
these be added a thorough knowledge of human nature and
a sincere desire for the salvation of souls, then the glory of
God will be revealed in us and we will be forgetful of self
and alive to the needs of others. We must see men and
women lost, going down to eternal death and must reach
them at any cost and be willing to gladly suffer the loss
of all things that we might gain Christ and win souls for
Him.</p>

<p>We should acquire from the Lord the gift of adaptation
to any and all kinds of work, people and places. We must
see the people from their own standpoint and then from
God's standpoint and then have implicit confidence in God
and in the power of the blood of Jesus to cleanse from all
sin. We must be humble and meek and yet strong, through
faith in God and His promises. Is anything too hard for
the Lord? And has He not told us, "Greater works than
these shall ye do because I go unto my Father?" Is He
not at the Father's right hand, interceding for us and for
the souls to whom He sends us?</p>

<p>We must be all things to all men that we might win
some. We must watch for opportunities for service and
be quick to use them when they are given us. We must be
ready to launch out into the deep at the Master's command.
We must have grace, not only to serve, but if need
be, to die, in order that souls might be saved&mdash;souls that
are going to destruction for the want of a kind word or a
helping hand at just the right time. I have often found
them upon the verge of suicide. Men and women in despair,
both in prison and outside, were goaded into desperation
and the enemy of their souls was urging them to
end it all&mdash;that nobody cared, and God had forgotten them.</p>

<p>How glad I have been to clasp their hand and tell them
there was One who cared; that He loved them still and I
have seen the long pent-up tears start from their eyes and
hope has sprung up once more in their desolate hearts. I
hope to hear God say in the Day of Judgment of some,
"Here are the discouraged, the tempted and tried ones, who
were almost lost, but who were won through your faithfulness."
To God be all the glory.</p>

<p>We must not seek our own ease. Jesus, in the Garden
of Gethsemane, would have died in agony, only that an angel
came and ministered unto Him, yet he prayed, "Not My
will, but Thine be done." Such must be our heartfelt cry
and we must abandon ourselves to God's will in all things
and forgetting ourselves and the opinions of the World,
seek to please Him only. Then He will make even our enemies
be at peace with us.</p>

<p>Multitudes all about us are going down to despair for
want of true love such as Jesus had when He said, "Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do," and
"Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more."</p>

<p>Having this spirit, God has promised to furnish us unto
every good work. That is, every work to which He calls
us. We each have our responsibility to meet, our especial
capability, our gift or talent. Then let us adapt ourselves
to the work which God has given us to do&mdash;not ignoring the
work of others, nor lording it over God's heritage, but each
abiding in the calling wherein we are called, having charity
for all, whether saints or sinners. Surely, with the field
so wide and the work so great, there is the greatest need
for love and the unity of the Spirit among all Christians.
Why there are so many divisions, I know not. I find true
and earnest hearts among all classes, all denominations and
all nationalities.</p>

<p>Jesus prayed, before He ascended on high, for his children,
that they all might be one as He and the Father were
one&mdash;one in purpose and one in heart. If we manifest this
oneness, sinners will come flocking home to God and souls
will be saved and God will get all the glory. The lack of
oneness among God's people stands in the way of souls and
the poor and ignorant are at a loss as to what to think or
believe.</p>

<p>Surely, there was never greater need for Holy Ghost,
Spirit-filled Christian workers than now, when false doctrine
is proclaimed on every side and in every form. But
let Christians unite, losing sight of everything but God and
souls and it will not be long until God will fulfill his promise
that a nation shall be born in a day. Oh, that there
might be a rallying of all of God's true children of every
class and nationality; that they might, with united forces,
charge upon the enemy and soon the world, which now
seems to be at variance, would be won for God and for our
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The masses are not reached</span> through the ordinary
channels of the churches. Look at the need of the Gospel
being carried to the railroad and street-car men, the soldiers,
sailors, policemen, firemen, and postmen. Are we
seeking to reach the people? We must get the love of God
in our hearts to that degree that we will not only be willing
to suffer, but to die for them, and mean it&mdash;mean business,
and fast and pray and call mightily on God for help and
direction, and look to Him for results. Don't expect an
easy time&mdash;don't let us expect to be above our Master.
Jesus had no place to lay His head. He went among the
despised, the poor, the fallen, the lowest of earth; and if
He were to return now, how many of us would He find
filling the places appointed us?</p>

<p>The Lord is ready to do exceeding abundantly above all
we can think or ask, and will bless every unselfish effort
on our part to help save a lost world. When the end comes
for you and me, dear one, let us have our lamps trimmed
and burning, ready to go in to the marriage supper of the
Lamb, which is to soon take place.</p>

<p>God help us do our part, to be instant in season and out
of season; to keep free in our souls; to be filled with the
spirit of Jesus; to be ever ready with a kind word,
a "God bless you," a silent prayer, a warm hand-clasp.
Let us be quick to follow the leadings of the Holy
Spirit, humbling ourselves under the mighty hand of God.
Let us take a firmer hold on God and be ourselves in His
hands. Let us see our own responsibility as God sees it,
and by His grace measure up to it.</p>

<p>Then the hosts of hell shall not be able to prevail against
us and God will use us to his glory, and with hearts filled
with love and compassion, we will go forward and God
will go with us and give us victory.</p>


<h4>MY BOY IN INDIA.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Some years ago the Lord made plain to me that I should
support a famine orphan in India, and since that time He
has enabled me to give twenty dollars per year for the support
of my adopted son, John Ryder Wheaton, named for
my brother, who departed this life a few years ago, and for
myself. I give his picture and a copy of his first letter to
me, translated by one of the missionaries; also some letters
from Brother and Sister Jarvis, in charge of the Orphanage
in Lahore, India. We ask the prayers of our readers
for this dear boy, and if God should lay it upon any of
your hearts to provide for one of these famine orphans, any
money sent to the Missionary Home in Tabor, Iowa, will
be promptly forwarded to any orphanage or missionary you
may designate. God has laid this boy upon my heart, and
the tie is dearer, perhaps, because I am alone in the world,
having laid my only child in the grave with my husband.
My heart was touched when I received this letter from
John's own hand, and sometimes I long to see and know
him for myself. He is being trained for a missionary, and
when my labors are ended, I hope to see him coming home
from India, bringing his trophies with him&mdash;precious souls
from his own native land, and that there we may praise
the Lord through all eternity together.</p>

<p>Lahore, Frontier Faith Mission, April 12, 1904.&mdash;Dear
Mama:&mdash;Salam, I am well by the grace of Lord Jesus
Christ, and hope you are well. Matter is this that I live
here very happy, few days ago that the fever and cough attacked
me so I went to the hospital, now I am well and do
my duty. I learned the work of Gardener. I pray every
day. May God help me and make me His true Christian
and grant me abundant grace. I also hope that you do
pray for me. I pray for you. Here are all well. I am also
with other boys well. My compliment to you,</p>

Dec. 11, 1901.&mdash;Dear Sister Wheaton&mdash;We have chosen
for you a bright little boy by the name of Ruthena,
about ten years old. He is one of our brightest little boys,
one that bids fair to be something for God. He is a shoemaker
by trade and is doing well at it. We are endeavoring
to teach the boys trades, wanting them to be like Paul
where they can preach the Gospel while they make tents
for a living. Ruthena is a bright boy in every way and
will be named John Ryder as you wished. We do not have
time to write often but our hearts are with you.</p>

The Lord bless and repay you. Continue to pray for him,
and for the rest of our great family. God is hearing prayer
for us. There are some slight fever cases among the children.
This is our sickly season. Unite in prayer that our
workers may keep well. We are all burdened because of
the lack of workers and much has to remain undone.</p>

<p>Though burdened, we will stand at our post until Jesus
comes. (R. V.) Our faith is in God. So many young

<h4>PREACHING IN THE PEST-HOUSE.</h4>

<p>Just why the dear Lord saw best to permit me to take
the loathsome disease of smallpox into my system, I know
not; but I do know the same God that made man and pronounced
him very good, permitted Job and many others of
His people to suffer many things. Of one thing I am certain,
the Lord permitted me to preach the Gospel in the
pest-house. No one was allowed there but the physician
of the Board of Health and those in charge, and there were
many lost ones there and no gospel services for years and
not even the superintendent and his family were allowed to
go to church. I had held meetings in almost every other place
and I now had opportunity to go there, this being the only
way to get to them. During the summer of 1901 I was
taken very ill and the sixth doctor pronounced the disease
smallpox. There was no alternative but to prepare for the
hospital, which I did unaided. This was remarkable; for
I had been very near death, the suffering both mentally and
physically was so intense and the agony so great. Surely
God heard the prayers of His believing ones and raised me
up to once more go forth to glorify His name by preaching
His gospel and singing His praises. Bless His holy
name!</p>

<p>I was hedged in with God. He got the glory of my
healing. I bless the Lord that in answer to prayer He
never let one person take the disease from me that we
knew of. When leaving the minister's home where I was
taken sick, I was shouting and praising the Lord. I told
the mission workers I was sure I could go to Heaven even
from the pest-house, with the smallpox. I told the young
sister with me to bring the tracts for service in the hospital.
I had told her that morning that there would be several
doctors call and hold a consultation and pronounce the disease
smallpox and they would take me to the pest-house,
and I expected I would die there. I had such victory in
my soul that I just shouted and praised the Lord.</p>

<p>In the hospital I was given the privilege of all the wards
to sing and pray and talk with the patients. Some were in
a very dangerous condition, and others convalescent.
Others were trembling with fear, having been exposed and
quarantined here to protect the public from contagion.
Those were weeks of suffering, although full of service and
song. The hymns were listened to with the greatest delight
even by foreigners who could not understand our language.
I often wonder why professing Christians are not as careful
about the spread of sin as people are about the transmitting
of disease. The same day I left the hospital the
Lord sent me out on a long journey to preach the gospel
on the train. As I was talking with the conductor, there
was a sudden stop and he ran to find the cause. Our engine
had become disabled on a bridge, and as a train was
coming behind us, the trainmen ran to flag the coming
train before it should overtake us; but it was too late. I
dropped on my knees on the platform of the rear car and
asked God to spare our lives. I arose, took in the situation,
went to my seat in the center of the car and again
knelt in prayer. I turned to look just as the engine struck
our car, raising it about five feet in the air, crushing timbers
and glass, and causing a panic among the passengers.
I was blest of God through it all, and went immediately to
work holding meetings while we waited some hours for
help to come. I see so plainly the hand of the Lord in all
this. I might have left the train when on the rear platform,
but I felt impressed to stay with those on board and call on
God for help. Do you wonder that when all our lives were
spared I felt that as the Lord gave all on the ship into
Paul's hands, so in this case, as in many others, the wise
Master gave me those who traveled with me? "As thy days
so shall thy strength be." "A thousand shall fall at thy
side and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not
come nigh thee."</p>


<h4>HOW THE LORD PROVIDES.</h4>

<p>One night in San Francisco while holding a meeting in
the Old Adelphi Theater, I was impressed to give a dollar
to a sister who often sang and exhorted in our service and
who assisted me that night. At the close of the meeting I
handed her a silver dollar. She seemed much surprised and
said, "No, I should not take this from you." I told her
God showed me to give her that dollar and I must obey
Him; so she took the money.</p>

<p>The next day, while waiting for the street car on a public
thoroughfare, I saw a man giving out ladies' fashion
plates. I spoke kindly to him and suggested how much
more good he could do by giving out tracts. He replied
that that was the way he made his living&mdash;that the firm
paid him for his services. I told him that God would care
for him if he only trusted and served Him, but he evidently
thought me somewhat of a fanatic. Just then a well-dressed
old gentleman spoke to me and said, "Do you belong
to the Salvation Army?" I said that I did not and
he then asked, "What is your work?" I answered, "I am
a missionary to the prisoners and lost girls." He handed
me a dollar and hurried on. The man with whom I had
been speaking looked on surprised and said, "Who was
that man?" I said, "I do not know; I never saw him before
and may never see him again." He was evidently
thinking, for I had told him that God provided for me and
would provide for him if he would but work for Him, and
God was giving him an object lesson. I said, "I believe
the Lord sent that man to convince you that what I said
was true for I never ask any person for money, but trust
all to Providence."</p>

<p>Going on my way later in the day, outside the city where
I changed cars, I saw hurrying toward me the same man
who had given me the dollar in the morning. He said,
"I have been thinking all day about you and what you said
and here is another dollar for you." I told him how I felt
God had used him to convince the fashion plate man, that
if we fully trust and serve the Lord He will provide for us.
I have never seen either of these men again since that day,
but God sent me the two dollars in place of the one dollar
I had given that poor woman the night before, in the meeting.</p>

<p>The sequel was given me sometime after this when I
again met that poor sister. She said to me, "Sister
Wheaton, I want to tell you about the dollar you gave me
that night in the meeting," and then she said: "I had nothing
in my house for my children to eat (there was a large
family of them), and husband was out of work. I had to
wash next day and had neither soap nor starch, and I had
to go across the city to pray for a sick woman, whose son
had said that he would believe in God and serve him if his
mother were healed in answer to prayer. I had to take
that young man with me and pay his car fare and my own.
The mother was healed and the young man, being convinced,
yielded himself to God and was converted and became
a Christian." And then she added, "All this your dollar
did, for I had prayed God to send me a dollar that night
and you obeyed God and see what was accomplished
through obedience to the God who hears the ravens when
they cry and notes the sparrow's fall."</p>

<p>Then I related to her my experience to show how the
Lord used a stranger to return me double, or two dollars
instead of one, and perhaps saved two men&mdash;for God was
evidently dealing both with the stranger who gave me the
money and with the one with whom I was speaking on the
street.</p>


<h4>MISCELLANEOUS INCIDENTS.</h4>

<p>I was once called upon to minister to the needs of a
woman who was burned almost to death. I assisted the
doctor as best I could to dress the burns. I took the scissors
and cut the loose flesh from her arm, and held her
while the doctor filed the rings from her hands.</p>

<p>If I had not been previously convinced by the Scriptures
of the folly of wearing rings I think this awful sight would
have been sufficient to satisfy any doubts in my mind, as
they cut so cruelly deep into the charred and swollen flesh.
She finally passed away to that land where there shall be
no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>While being entertained at a certain place a few years
ago, a caller was announced one evening, to see "Mother
Wheaton." Entering the parlor a tall, handsome man,
dressed in the uniform of a policeman, advanced to greet
me. I bowed politely, but perhaps a little distantly, as I
did not know him. He came forward and extended his
hand cordially, saying, "Don't you know me, Mother?" I
said, "No, I do not know you." He said "I sang in &mdash;&mdash;
prison in the choir. I served a term there and heard you
sing and preach there. This is my daughter," and he presented
a nice looking young lady who was with him. He
said he now held a responsible position and was getting
along nicely, and invited me to come and visit his family.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>While holding meetings in a little town in one of the
southern states, I was entertained at the home of a wealthy
man who was accused of crime. He had a beautiful wife
and lovely children. I was greatly troubled about his condition.
I held meetings there in the home. I was treated
very kindly and cordially welcomed, but he would not yield
to God. I warned him faithfully, and plead with him to
repent of his sins and become a Christian. I told him that
a terrible calamity awaited him if he did not yield himself
to the Lord. I went away believing it was his last chance
of salvation. Not long after that he laid in wait to kill a
man against whom he had had a grudge for some time; but
the other man seeing his intention, drew his revolver and
fired in self-defence. The man fell dead. He had had
his last call. He had rejected the Lord and was ushered into
eternity without a moment's warning.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One day years ago, in M&mdash;&mdash;, Mississippi, I went on
the street to hold a meeting. A policeman came along and
forbade me after I had begun to sing, saying it was against
the law to hold religious services on the street. My spirit
was grieved as I felt the Lord had a work for me to do
among the poor and lowly who were too poorly clad to attend
church services. A sister (a woman of God who entertained
me) was with me. She then proposed taking me
to see a sick child, an infant. When we reached the house
we found the young parents weeping over their dying child.
My heart was touched with sympathy, and kneeling down
I asked Him who said, "Suffer little children to come unto
me," to heal the child for His glory. I believed His word
where it says, "The prayer of faith shall save the sick."
My faith touched divinity, the child was healed and the
young parents, seeing the power of God manifested, were
converted, and gave their lives to God for His service.</p>

<h3>Selections from My Scrap Book.</h3>


<p>Many of the selections given in this chapter were written
by prisoners and given me by them. The others may not
all be new to the reader, but I have thought them of sufficient
value to thus preserve, as they may be reread with
profit, and no doubt may be read here by many who have
not seen them elsewhere. Such will surely feel the time
it takes to read them well spent.</p>

<p>Many of the songs I have sung are not in print here, as
they are familiar or may be found in popular books; others
I thought might be copyrighted and I do not know the
owner, etc. I have not meant to use any copyright selections
without procuring the right to do so, but if through
mistake any have been used I shall be glad to make due
requital.</p>

She came to earth through no royal line of ancestry. No booming

jeweled hand beckoned her to a place of rank and title. Nothing
in babyhood or girlhood distinguished her above what is visible in
ten thousand homes to-day. But as she stepped over the threshold
into womanhood, there fell upon her a great calamity&mdash;a cruel accident
made her a cripple and an invalid for life. But in her afflictions
she arose to a sublimity and sweetness of soul that has challenged
the admiration of two continents. And out of the awful
shadows that fell upon her she has gathered up the sunbeams of
God's smiles and scattered them into the dark places of earth. Out
of that one little darkened room in Kentucky there has gone forth
an inspiration that has fired the heart of heroic Christian womanhood.
And out of the darkness that smote her pathway leaped the
lances of light that pierces the gloom of prison walls. A gleam from
that radiant life touches the poet's fancy, and gives us these beautiful
lines.</p>

<p>The following was written by a young brother who, with
his wife, were with me for a time in my work. In thanking
them for a kindness done me I used the words, "Jesus is
looking on," implying that He would reward them. Only
an hour or so afterward the young brother handed me these
lines, suggested by my words:</p>

<p>Little did I think when I spoke the words that they would
make so deep an impression upon his mind. How little we
realize what a word may do.</p>

<h4>HOW GOD CALLS MISSIONARIES OUT OF
PRISON CELLS.</h4>

<p class="center">S. H. HADLEY.<br />

<em>Superintendent of the Old McAuley Mission.</em></p>

<p>Some of the best missionaries this world ever knew are
men who have been sentenced to long terms in prison.
Wholly shut away from the world and its dreadful temptations,
God had a chance to speak to them. Jerry McAuley
was a wonderful example of this, and that drunken
loafer and thief was finally used so wonderfully by the Lord
God that his name has gone all over this world and has
been an inspiration to millions. He was sent to prison from
the Fourth Ward of New York for fifteen years at the age
of nineteen.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning in the chapel the speaker was old
"Awful" Gardener, an old-time ruffian and prize-fighter in
New York, but God had got hold of him and he had been
wonderfully saved. With tears streaming down his face, he
told of the love of Christ, and he said, "Boys, I ought to be
wearing the stripes the same as you are, and I feel a deep
sympathy for you."</p>

<p>He also quoted some verses from the Scriptures, and
after the boys had gone back to their cells Jerry found a
Bible in the ventilator of his cell, and, looking it over aimlessly,
tried to find the text that "Awful" Gardener had
quoted, but instead he found that Christ came to save sinners,
and the Holy Spirit showed him his dreadful past
life. As the day grew into night, Jerry got down on his
knees and began to pray. He had never prayed before,
but now he cried to God for help and mercy. How long he
was there he does not know, but some time during the night
a glorious light dispelled the deep darkness of his soul, and
he cried out, "Oh, praise God, I found Jesus, and He gives
peace to my soul." The unusual sound brought the keeper,
who asked, "What is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Jerry answered, "I found Jesus, that's what's the matter
with me."</p>

<p>He found some opportunities to breathe out the new-found
hopes of his soul and the love of Jesus to the prisoners
about him. Soon a revival broke out in the prison such
as never had been seen before or since, and Jerry was the
center of it all. He was pardoned in 1864, but when he
got home he had no friends, no money, and he soon fell
into bad company, and got to be a worse scoundrel than he
ever was before. It was after this he became known as
the dangerous East River pirate. He was reclaimed in
1868, and although he fell five times after that during the
first eight or nine months, he was finally anchored to Christ.</p>

<p>Do you know that every drunkard uses tobacco? Jerry
was no exception. Some faithful friends said to him. "Jerry,
give up your tobacco for Jesus' sake," and he gave it up,
and then he never fell afterward.</p>

<p>He was afterward married to Maria, his faithful wife,
who also was redeemed from a drunkard's life, and in 1872
opened the world-renowned McAuley Mission, at 316 Water
Street, down on the East Side, nearly under the Brooklyn
Bridge.</p>

<p>He stayed here ten years, and then opened the Cremorne
Mission, Thirty-second Street and Sixth Avenue, where he
died in 1884, and had the largest funeral of any private
citizen who was ever buried in New York.</p>

<p>The writer succeeded Jerry McAuley down there, and
the work is going on night and day. Drunkards and thieves
come in by the thousand, and, thank God, many of them are
saved unto life eternal. The writer is also a convert of
Jerry McAuley Mission.&mdash;<cite>The Life Boat.</cite></p>

<h4>OUTSIDE THE PRISON WALLS.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Free, free at last he left the dreary jail,</span>
<span class="i1">And stepped into the dewy April night;</span>
<span class="i0">Once more he breathed, untainted, God's pure air,</span>

<span class="i1">Full twenty years with hopeless misery rife!</span>
<span class="i0">His thoughts sped backward till they reached that day</span>
<span class="i1">When he had entered that grim house, a boy&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Naught but a boy in stature and in years,</span>
<span class="i1">But with a heart all bare of hope and joy.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For in a dreadful moment, crazed with rum,</span>
<span class="i1">His hand had laid a fellow creature low,</span>
<span class="i0">And for that glass of brandy in his brain</span>
<span class="i1">Full twenty years of wretchedness and woe.</span>
<span class="i0">And now, a gray-haired man, he walked again</span>
<span class="i1">The very path his boyish feet had pressed</span>
<span class="i0">So many, many years ago;</span>
<span class="i1">And now he wandered lonely, seeking rest.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where should he go? Where now his footsteps turn?</span>
<span class="i1">No living soul was there to welcome him!</span>
<span class="i0">No friend of all his youthful days he knew</span>
<span class="i1">Would greet again this wanderer in sin.</span>
<span class="i0">Unconsciously, he sought his boyhood's home,</span>
<span class="i1">The low, white cottage he had held so dear;</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas standing in its old accustomed place,</span>
<span class="i1">But strangers had dwelt there for many a year.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where next? The tears stood in his mournful eyes;</span>
<span class="i1">His breath came thick and fast&mdash;he could not stir,</span>
<span class="i0">But leaned upon the old familiar gate</span>
<span class="i1">With thoughts of mother&mdash;O, could he find her?</span>
<span class="i0">Where was she now&mdash;that mother, sweet and good,</span>
<span class="i1">Who tried with tears and prayers to save her boy,</span>
<span class="i0">Who knelt alone at midnight's solemn hour</span>
<span class="i1">And mourned for him who should have been her joy.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His faltering steps at last he vaguely turned</span>
<span class="i1">Unto the silent churchyard near the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And stood alone while pitying moonbeams spread</span>
<span class="i1">Around his form a veil of charity.</span>
<span class="i0">Alone with God in that still, solemn place,</span>
<span class="i1">Alone with hundreds of the silent dead,</span>
<span class="i0">The outcast stood with lowly, sin-sick heart,</span>
<span class="i1">The cold night dew upon his drooping head.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last he found her in a place apart,</span>
<span class="i1">Where moonbeams sparkled through the willow boughs,</span>
<span class="i0">And shone upon her simple headstone white</span>
<span class="i1">That marked the limit of her narrow house.</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas but a snowy marble, simple, plain,</span>
<span class="i1">That bore her name, her age, and just below&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"Died of a broken heart"&mdash;alas! he knew</span>
<span class="i1">The cause of all that life and death of woe.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He flung himself face down upon the grass,</span>
<span class="i1">Alone between the living and the dead,</span>
<span class="i0">And wept and prayed beside the lonely grave</span>
<span class="i1">Until in sorrow's slumber sunk his head.</span>
<span class="i0">They found him in the morning, stiff and cold,</span>
<span class="i1">His hands clasped o'er his mother's lowly grave,</span>
<span class="i0">His head upon its turf, as though he thought</span>
<span class="i1">That turf the bosom his poor heart had craved.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon his pallid cheeks the trace of tears</span>
<span class="i1">Showed in the glowing ray of morning's sun,</span>
<span class="i0">But o'er that face there shone a wondrous peace,</span>
<span class="i1">A smile of joy now all his life was done.</span>
<span class="i0">Men marveled that he looked so young again</span>
<span class="i1">Despite his crown of sorrow-silvered hair,</span>
<span class="i0">And tender-hearted women sighed and wept<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And smiled to think that they had found him there.</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! God is good! with loving tenderness</span>
<span class="i1">He saw the sad, repentant soul alone</span>
<span class="i0">Weep out his sin upon his mother's grave,</span>
<span class="i1">And gently led the weary wanderer home.</span>
<span class="i0">This we believe: That now in Heaven's street</span>
<span class="i1">The mother and her son are reconciled,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the pain and sin of earth below</span>
<span class="i1">Are blotted out, and he is God's own child.</span>

<h4>LITTLE GRAVES.</h4>

<p>You have your little grave; I have mine. You have your
sad memories; I have mine. For,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is no flock, however tended,</span>
<span class="i1">But one dead lamb is there;</span>
<span class="i0">There is no fireside, howsoe'er defended,</span>
<span class="i1">But hath its vacant chair.</span>

</div></div>

<p>I have pleasant thoughts sometimes about these little
graves. I think what a safe place the little grave is. Temptations
never come there. Sins never pollute there. Tears,
pains, disappointments, bereavements, trials, cares, and
snares, are all unknown in that silent resting place. And
then, Jesus has the keys, and he keeps our treasures safely,
and guards them securely. No mother's heart is anxious
about a child that is laid in the little grave. No prayers of
anguish go up for it as for those tossed by the storms of
passion, sunk in the whirlpool of vice, or lost in the wide
wilderness of sorrow and of sin. There is now no need of
chiding, reproving, watching, and restraining. The chief
Shepherd bears the lamb on his own bosom, and it is forever
safe.</p>

<p>The little grave is a sacred place. The Lord of glory has
passed into the sepulchre, and from it he has opened up the
path of life. Hope blooms there, and hearts-ease and
amaranth blossom amid the shadows that linger over it, and
Jesus watches his treasures and counts his jewels in the
little graves.</p>

<p>The little grave shall be opened by and by. The night is
dark, but there is a flush of morn upon the mountains, and
a gleam of sunlight glows along the distant hills. He who
bears the keys of hell and of death, shall come back to open
the little graves, and call the sleepers forth. Then cherub
forms shall burst the silent tombs, and these green hillocks
shall bear their harvest for the garner of our God.&mdash;Sel.</p>

of the past.</em></p>


<h4>TWENTY&mdash;THIRTY-FOUR.</h4>

<p>The line of dingy-coated men stretched along the broad
granite walk and like a great gray serpent wound in and
out among the wagon shops and planing mills that filled
the prison yard.</p>

<p>Down beyond the foundry the beginning of the line, the
head of the serpent, was lost at the stairway leading to the
second floor of a long, narrow building in which whisk
brooms were manufactured.</p>

<p>An hour before, on the sounding of a brass gong at the
front, the same line had wound round the same corners into
the building whence now it crawled. There, the men had
seated themselves on four-legged stools before benches that
stretched across the room in rows. Before each man was
set a tin plate of boiled meat; a heavy cup of black coffee,
a knife, a fork, and a thick bowl of steaming, odorous soup.</p>

<p>During the meal other men, dressed like the hundreds
who were sitting, in suits of dull gray, with little round-crowned,
peaked-visored caps to match, moved in and out
between the rows, distributing chunks of fresh white bread
from heavy baskets. Now and then one of the men would
shake his head and the waiter would pass him by, but usually
a dozen hands were thrust into a basket at once to
clutch the regulation "bit" of half a pound. The men ate
ravenously, as if famished.</p>

<p>Yet a silence that appalled hovered over the long bare
dining-hall where eight hundred men were being fed.
There was no clatter of knives and forks; there were no
jests; they moved about as noiselessly as ghosts.</p>

<p>There were faces stamped with indelible marks of depravity
and vice, but now and then the "breadtossers"
would see uplifted a pair of frank blue eyes, in which
burned the light of hope. Men were there who dreamed
of a day to come when all would be forgiven and forgotten;
when a hand would again be held out in welcome, and
a kiss again be pressed to quivering lips. Men there were
of all kinds, of all countenances, young and old; the waving,
sunlit hair of youth side by side with locks in which
the snow was thickly sprinkled. All these men were paying
the penalty society imposes on proved criminals.</p>

<p>And now, their dinner over, they were marching back to
the shops and mills of the prison, where days and weeks
were spent at labor. Those men employed in the wagon-works
dropped out of the line when they came opposite the
entrance to their building. Those behind pushed forward
as their prison-mates disappeared, and never for more than
ten seconds was there a gap in the long, gray line.</p>

<p>The whisk-broom factory occupied the second floor of
the building at the far end of the prison yard. On the
ground floor men worked at lathes, turning out the wooden
handles to the brooms that were finished, sorted and tied up-stairs.
At the corner the line divided, sixty-five of the men
climbed the stairway to the second floor, the other thirty
entered the lathe-room below.</p>

<p>A dozen men in blue uniforms marched beside the line
on its way from the mess-hall, six on each side, at two
yards' distance. Their caps bore "Guard" in gold letters,
and each guard carried a short, heavy, crooked cane of polished
white hickory. On entering the work-room of the
second floor, the men assembled before a railed platform,
upon which a red-faced, coatless man stood behind a big
desk. In cold, metallic tones he called the numbers of the
convicts who in turn replied "Here!" when their numbers
were spoken.</p>

<p>"Twenty-thirty-four!" called the red-faced man. There
was no response.</p>

<p>"Twenty-thirty-four?" The red-faced man leaned over
the desk and glared down. Then a voice from somewhere
on the left answered "Here!"</p>

<p>"What was the matter with you the first time?" snapped
the foreman.</p>

<p>The man thus questioned removed his cap and took three
steps toward the platform. In feature the word "hard"
would describe him. His head was long, wide at the forehead,
and yet narrow between the temples. His eyes were
small and close together. His nose was flat, and mouth
hardly more than a straight cut in the lower part of his
face. The lower jaw was square and heavy, and the ears
protruded abnormally. A trifle above medium height with
a pair of drooping, twitching shoulders, the man looked
criminal.</p>

<p>To the question he replied doggedly, "I answered the
first time, sir, but I guess you didn't hear me."</p>

<p>The foreman gazed steadily at the man. Their eyes met.
The foreman's did not waver, but "2034" lowered his and
fumbled nervously at his cap.</p>

<p>"All right," said the foreman, quickly, "but I guess you'd
better report to the warden as soon as you get through in
here. Don't wait for any piece-work. Go to him as soon
as you have finished your task. I'll tell him you're coming.
He'll be waiting for you at the front office."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The convict did not raise his eyes. He
stepped back into the line.</p>

<p>Then, at the clap of the foreman's hands, the men broke
ranks, and each walked away to his own bench or machine.
Five minutes later, the swish on the corn-wisps as they
were separated and tied into rough brooms, and the occasional
tap of a hammer, were the only sounds in that long
room where sixty-five men toiled.</p>

<p>Now and then one of the men would go to the platform
where the foreman sat bent over half a dozen little books,
in which it was his duty to record the number of "tasks"
completed by each of the workmen "on his contract"&mdash;a
"task" in the prison vernacular being the work each man
is compelled to accomplish within a certain space of time.
On the approach of a workman the foreman would look
up and a few whispered words would pass between the
two. Then the broom-maker would dart into the stock
room, adjoining the factory, where, upon receiving a written
requisition from the foreman, the officer in charge
would give him the material he needed in his work&mdash;a ball
of twine, or a strip of plush with which the handles of the
brooms were decorated.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past three, 2034 crossed to the platform.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the foreman, as he eyed
keenly the man in the gray suit.</p>

<p>"A paper of small tacks," was the reply, quickly spoken.
The order was written, and as 2034 moved towards the
door leading toward the stock-room, the man on the platform
asked in an undertone, "Anything wrong, Bill?"</p>

<p>"That's what I don't know, George," the foreman replied.
"That man Riley's been acting queer of late. I've
got an idea there's something up his sleeve. There's not a
harder nut on the contract than that fellow, and by the
way he's been carrying on, sullen like and all that, I'm fearing
something's going to happen. You remember, don't
you? What, no? He's that Riley from Acorn. He came
in two years ago on a burglary job in Clive, where he shot
a drug clerk that offered objections to his carrying off all
there was in the shop. They made it manslaughter and
he's in for fifteen years. There's another warrant ready
for him when he gets out, for a job done four years ago in
Kentucky. He's a bad one. A fellow like that is no good
around this shop."</p>

<p>The guard smiled cynically at the foreman's suggestion
that a convict may be too bad even for prison surroundings.</p>

<p>"But I've got my eye on him," continued the foreman.
"I'm sending him up to the warden this afternoon. Say,
George, when you go back, will you tell the warden Riley's
coming up to call on him?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Bill," was the smiling reply of the guard as he
moved away. Twenty-thirty-four had returned with a
paper of tacks and gone directly to his bench.</p>

<p>It was a quarter of four by the foreman's watch when
the door at the head of the stairway opened and the warden
entered, accompanied by two friends whom he was
showing through the "plant," as he preferred to call the
prison.</p>

<p>"This is where the whisk-brooms are made," said the
warden. "On the floor below, which we just left, you will
remember we saw the boys turning out broom-handles.
Well, here the brooms are tied and sewed through by hand,
over at those benches. In the room beyond, through that
door, we keep the stuff handy that is called for from time
to time. In a further room is stored the material used in
the manufacture of the brooms, the tin tips, the tacks, the
twine, and about ten or twelve tons of broom straw."</p>

<p>As the warden ceased speaking, the foreman leaned
across the desk and tapped him on the shoulder. "Riley's
coming up to see you this afternoon. He's been acting
queer&mdash;don't answer the call and the like."</p>

<p>The warden only nodded, and continued his explanation
to the visitors.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, moving towards the door of the stock-room,
"if you will come over here I'll show you our store-room.
You see we have to keep a lot of material on hand.
Beyond this second room the stuff is stored up, and is taken
into the stock-room as it is wanted. Between the rooms
we have arranged these big sliding iron doors that, in case
of a fire, could be dropped, and thus, for a few minutes at
least, cut the flames off from any room but that in which
they originated. You see," pulling an iron lever which let
the heavy iron sheet slide to the floor, "that completes the
wall."</p>

<p>The visitor nodded. "Now, come on through the second
room, and into the third," there, ranged regularly on the
floor were huge bales of broom straw, and piled against the
walls were boxes upon boxes of tacks, velvet, ornamental
bits of metal, and all the other separate parts of the commercial
whisk broom.</p>

<p>The visitors examined the tacks and the tins and felt of
the bales of straw.</p>

<p>"Very interesting," observed one of the men, as he drew
his cigar case from his pocket, and biting the tip from one
of the cigars it contained, struck a little wax match on the
sole of his shoe. He held the match in his hand till it had
burned down, then threw it on the floor, and followed the
warden and the other visitor under the heavy iron screen
into the workingroom of the factory.</p>

<p>The foreman was busy at his books and did not observe
the little party as it passed through on the other side of the
broom-bins and out at the big door.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, 2034 happened to look out through
the window across his bench and he saw the warden with
his friends crossing the prison yards to the foundry. A
guard just then sauntered into the room and stopped at the
first of the bins. He idly picked up one of the finished
brooms and examined it. His attention a moment later
was attracted by some one pulling at his coat from behind.
He turned.</p>

<p>"Why, Tommy, my boy, what is it?"</p>

<p>The two soft brown eyes of a little boy were turned up
to him. "I'm looking for papa," replied the little fellow.
"The foreman down-stairs said he come up here. Uncle
George is back in the house, and mamma sent me out to
find papa."</p>

<p>The guard patted the little fellow's head. "And we'll
find him, Tommy," he said. He went over to the foreman's
desk. "Bill, did the warden come up here? Tommy is
looking for him; his mother sent him out."</p>

<p>The foreman raised his eyes from his books. "Yes," he
replied, "he went in there, with a couple of gentlemen."</p>

<p>The guard looked down at the little boy. "He's in the
store-room," he said, "you'll find him in there, Tommy."</p>

<p>Then he turned and walked out of the shop. The child
ran on into the room beyond. His father was not there.
The stock-keeper did not observe the little boy as he tiptoed,
in a childish way, past the desk. Tommy passed on
into the farther room. He knew he would find his father
in there, and he would crawl along between the tiers of
straw bales and take him by surprise.</p>

<p>He had hardly passed when the stock-keeper, raising his
head from the list of material he was preparing, held his
face and sniffed the air. Quietly he rose from his revolving
chair and went to the straw-room door. He merely
peered inside. Turning suddenly, he pressed upon the
lever near the door and the iron screen slid down into place,
cutting off the farther room. Then, snatching a few books
that lay on his desk, he slipped out into the shop, and at
that door released the second screen. As it fell into place
with a slight crunching noise, the foreman turned in his
chair. The eyes of the two met. The stock-keeper raised
his hand and touched his lip with the first finger. He
crossed rapidly to the desk.</p>

<p>"Get the men out! Get the men out!" he gasped. "The
store-room is on fire!"</p>

<p>The foreman rapped on the table twice. Every man in
that room turned and faced the desk.</p>

<p>"Work is over for today," said the foreman. His manner
was ominously calm, and the men looked at one another
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Fall in!"</p>

<p>At the order, the dingy gray suits formed in the same
old serpent, and the line moved rapidly through the door
at the end of the room and down the outside stairs.</p>

<p>There, in front of the building, they were halted, and a
guard dispatched to find the warden. He was discovered
in the foundry. "Fire in the broom-shop!" whispered the
guard.</p>

<p>The warden's face paled. He dashed through the doorway,
and one minute later came around the corner of the
building, just in time to see the first signs of flames against
the windows of the rear room up-stairs.</p>

<p>Within five seconds, a troop of fifteen guards had drawn
the little hand-engine from its house and hitched the hose
to the hydrant nearest the shop. From all the other buildings
the men were being marched to their cells.</p>

<p>"These men!" hurriedly whispered the foreman to the
warden. "What shall I do with them?"</p>

<p>"Get 'em inside as soon as you can! This won't last
long, the front of the building is cut off. It'll all be over
in ten minutes."</p>

<p>The foreman gave an order. At that instant a woman
came running down the prison yard. Reaching the warden's
side, she fell against him heavily.</p>

<p>"Why, Harriet," he exclaimed, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she gasped, "Tommy! Tommy! Where is
Tommy?"</p>

<p>A guard at the end of the engine rail turned ashy white.
He raised a hand to his head, and with the other grasped
the wheel to keep from falling. Then he cried, "Mr. Jeffries,
I&mdash;I believe Tommy is up there in the stock-room.
He went to look&mdash;"</p>

<p>The warden clutched the man's arm. "Up there? Up
there?" he cried.</p>

<p>The sudden approach of the woman and the words that
followed had wrought so much confusion that the men had
paid no attention to the foreman's command, and he had
even failed to notice their lack of attention, in the excitement
of that moment.</p>

<p>"Great God!" cried the warden. "What can I do&mdash;what
can I do? No one can live up there!"</p>

<p>There was a crash. One of the windows fell out. "Get
a ladder!" some one cried. A guard ran back toward the
prison-house. Then, in the midst of the hubbub, a man in
a dingy gray suit stepped out a yard from the line of convicts.
His prison number was 2034. He touched his little
square cap.</p>

<p>"If you'll give me permission, I think I can get up there,"
was all he said.</p>

<p>"You! you!" exclaimed the warden. "No, no; I will
tell no man to do it!"</p>

<p>There was a second crash. Another window had fallen
out, and now the tongues of flame were lapping the outer
walls above.</p>

<p>The convict made no reply. With a bound he was at the
end of the line and dashing up the stairway.</p>

<p>The warden's wife was on her knees, clinging to the
hand of her husband. In his eyes was a dead, cold look.
A few men bit their lips, and a faint shadow of a smile
played about the mouths of others. They all waited. A
convict had broken a regulation&mdash;had run from the line!
He would be punished! Even as he had clambered up the
stairs a guard had cried, "shall I shoot?"</p>

<p>The silence was broken by a shriek from the woman
kneeling at the warden's feet. "Look!" she cried, and
pointed towards the last of the up-stairs windows.</p>

<p>There, surrounded by a halo of smoke, and hemmed in
on all sides by flames, stood a man in a dingy gray suit.
One sleeve was on fire, but he beat out the flames with his
left hand. Those below heard him cry, "I've got him!"
Then the figure disappeared. Instantly it returned, bearing
something in its arms. It was the limp form of a child.</p>

<p>All saw the man wrap smoking straw round the little
body and tie round that two strands of heavy twine. Then
that precious burden was lowered out of the window. The
father rushed forward and held up his hands to receive it.</p>

<p>Another foot&mdash;he hugged the limp body of his boy to his
breast! On the ground a little way back lay a woman, as
if dead.</p>

<p>"Here's the ladder!" yelled the foreman, and that moment
the eyes that were still turned upon the window above
where stood a man in a dingy gray suit, witnessed a spectacle
that will reappear before them again and again in visions
of the night.</p>

<p>The coat the man wore was ablaze. Flames shot on
either side of him and above him. Just as the ladder was
placed against the wall, a crackling was heard&mdash;not the
crackling of the fire. Then like a thunderbolt, a crash occurred
that caused even the men in their cells to start. The
roof caved in.</p>

<p>In the prison yard that line of convicts saw 2034 reel and
fall backwards, and heard, as he fell, his last cry, "I'm
a-comin', warden!"</p>

<p>He was a convicted criminal, and died in prison gray.
But it would seem not wonderful to the warden if, when
that man's soul took flight, the recording angel did write
his name on the eternal Book of Record, with a strange
cabalistic sign, a ring around a cross&mdash;that stands for "good
behavior."&mdash;<cite>The Youth's Companion.</cite></p>

<h4>SWEET REVENGE.</h4>

<p>A few years ago while Robert Stewart was Governor of
Missouri, a steamboat man was brought in from the penitentiary
for a pardon. He was a large, powerful fellow,
and when the governor looked at him he seemed strangely
affected. He scrutinized him long and closely. Finally he
signed the document that restored to the prisoner his liberty.
Before he handed it to him he said, "You will commit
some other crime and be in the penitentiary again, I fear."</p>

<p>The man solemnly promised that he would not. The governor
looked doubtful, mused a few minutes and said, "You
will go back on the river and be a mate again, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The man replied that he would.</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to promise me one thing," resumed
the governor. "I want you to pledge your word that when
you are mate again, you will never take a billet of wood in
your hand and drive a sick boy out of a bunk to help you
load your boat on a stormy night."</p>

<p>The boatman said he would not, and inquired what he
meant by asking him such a question.</p>

<p>The governor replied, "Because some day that boy may
become a governor, and you may want him to pardon you
for a crime. One dark stormy night many years ago you
stopped your boat on the Mississippi River to take on a load
of wood. There was a boy on board working his way from
New Orleans to St. Louis, but he was very sick of fever
and was lying in a bunk. You had plenty of men to do the
work but you went to that boy with a stick of wood in your
hand and drove him with blows and curses out into the
wretched night and kept him toiling like a slave until the
load was completed. I was that boy. Here is your pardon.
Never again be guilty of such brutality."</p>

<p>The man, cowering and hiding his face, went out without
a word.</p>

<p>What a noble revenge that was, and what a lesson for a
bully.&mdash;<cite>Success.</cite></p>

<h4>A TRUE HERO.</h4>

<p>Two men were sinking a shaft. It was dangerous business,
for it was necessary to blast the rock. It was their
custom to cut the fuse with a sharp knife. One man then
entered the bucket and made a signal to be hauled up.
When the bucket again descended, the other man entered
it, and with one hand on the signal rope and the other holding
the fire, he touched the fuse, made the signal, and was
rapidly drawn up before the explosion took place.</p>

<p>One day they left the knife above, and rather than ascend
to procure it, they cut the fuse with a sharp stone. It took
fire. "The fuse is on fire!" Both men leaped into the
bucket, and made the signal; but the windlass would haul
up but one man at a time; only one could escape. One of
the men instantly leaped out, and said to the other, "Up wi'
ye; I'll be in heaven in a minute." With lightning speed
the bucket was drawn up, and the one man was saved. The
explosion took place. Men descended, expecting to find the
mangled body of the other miner; but the blast had loosened
a mass of rock, and it lay diagonally across him; and, with
the exception of a few bruises and a little scorching, he was
unhurt. When asked why he urged his comrade to escape,
he gave a reason that sceptics would laugh at. If there is
any being on the face of the earth I pity, it is a sceptic. I
would not be called "a sceptic," today for all this world's
wealth. They may call it superstition or fanaticism, or
whatever they choose. But what did this hero say when
asked, "Why did you insist on this other man's ascending?"
In his quaint dialect, he replied, "Because I knowed my soul
was safe; for I've give it in the hands of Him of whom it is
said, that 'faithfulness is the girdle of his reins,' and I
knowed that what I gied Him He'd never gie up. But
t'other chap was an awful wicked lad, and I wanted to gie
him another chance." All the infidelity in the world cannot
produce such a signal act of heroism as that.&mdash;<cite>Selected.</cite></p>


<h4>THE "KID."</h4>

<p>It was not a long procession or a pleasing one but it attracted
much attention.</p>

<p>There was a policeman in the lead. Beside him walked
a stockey, bullnecked young fellow in a yellowish suit of
loud plaid. His face was bloody and his right wrist encircled
by the bracelet of the "twisters" which shackled him
to his captor. The face of the policeman was also bloody
and his clothes were torn. Behind these two walked three
other patrolmen, each with a handcuffed prisoner.</p>

<p>The "kid" and his "gang" had been caught in the act of
robbing a saloon, and the fight had been lively, although
short. The prisoners had been taken to the detectives' office,
and photographed and registered for the rogues' gallery.
They were now on their way to court, and thence, in
all probability, to jail.</p>

<p>At Broadway there was a jam of cars and heavy trucks,
and the procession had to wait. Nobody has been able to
tell just what happened, but they all agree as to the essential
points. First the bystanders saw a streak of yellow,
which was the kid; then a streak of blue which was the policeman.
The prisoner had wrenched the twisters from his
captors' hand, and made a dash across the tracks. The policeman,
thinking, of course that he was trying to escape,
had followed.</p>

<p>Then everybody saw a little child toddling along in the
middle of the track. A cable-car, with clanging bell, was
bearing down upon it with a speed which the gripman
seemed powerless to check. The baby held up its hands,
and laughed at the sound of the gong. On the other side of
the street a woman was screaming and struggling in the
arms of three or four men who were trying to keep her
from sacrificing her own life to save that of her child.</p>

<p>Then the kid stood there with the child safe in his arms,
the steel twisters hanging from his wrist. He set the baby
down gently at his feet, loosened the clasp of the chubby
hand on his big red fist, and quietly held out his wrist to the
policeman to be handcuffed again. He had one chance in a
million for his life when he made that desperate leap, but
he had not hesitated the fraction of a second.</p>


<h4>CHARGED WITH MURDER.</h4>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say why sentence
of death should not be passed upon you?"</p>

<p>A solemn hush fell over the crowded court-room, and
every person waited in almost breathless expectation for the
answer to the judge's question.</p>

<p>"I have, your honor! I stand here convicted of the murder
of my wife. Witnesses have testified that I was a loafer,
a drunkard and a wretch; that I returned from one of
my debauches and fired the shot that killed the wife I had
sworn to love, cherish and protect. While I have no remembrance
of committing the awful deed, I have no right
to condemn the verdict of the jury, for their verdict is in accordance
with the evidence.</p>

<p>"But, may it please the court, I wish to show that I am
not alone responsible for the murder of my wife! The
judge on this bench, the jury in the box, the lawyers within
this bar and most of the witnesses, including the pastor of
the church, are also guilty before God and will have to
stand with me before His judgment throne, where we shall
all be righteously judged.</p>

<p>"If it had not been for the saloons of my town, I never
would have become a drunkard; my wife would not have
been murdered; I would not be here now, soon to be hurled
into eternity.</p>

<p>"For one year our town was without a saloon. For one
year I was a sober man. For one year my wife and children
were happy and our little home was a paradise.</p>

<p>"I was one of those who signed remonstrances against re-opening
the saloons of our town. One-half of this jury, the
prosecuting attorney on this case, and the judge who sits
on this bench, all voted for the saloons. By their votes and
influence the saloons were opened, and they have made me
what I am.</p>

<p>"Think you that the Great Judge will hold me&mdash;the poor,
weak, helpless victim&mdash;alone responsible for the murder of
my wife? Nay; I, in my drunken, frenzied, irresponsible
condition have murdered one; but you have deliberately
voted for the saloons which have murdered thousands, and
they are in full operation today with your consent. You
legalized the saloons that made me a drunkard and a murderer,
and you are guilty with me before God and man for
the murder of my wife.</p>

<p>"I will close by solemnly asking God to open your blind
eyes to your own individual responsibility, so that you will
cease to give your support to this hell-born traffic."&mdash;<cite>Sel.</cite></p>

<h4>THE DRESS QUESTION.</h4>

<p>One day, at Louisville, riding with Mrs. Wheaton to visit
the sick prisoners, she said, "Do you think it your duty to
rebuke Christians who wear jewelry?" I saw her question
was a kindly reproof to me, and said, "If the Lord wants
me to give up the jewelry I have, He will show me." "Yes,
He will," she answered; "for I am praying for you." The
next morning the friend who was entertaining me told me
her little eleven-year-old daughter, Emma, just converted,
said, "Mamma, I wish you would read to me in the Bible
where it says not to wear jewelry." The mother read the
verses. Then the child said, "Mamma, if the Lord does
not want me to wear jewelry, I don't want to;" and she
brought her little pin and ring to her mother. I took my
Bible and read, "Whose adorning, let it not be that outward
adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold, or of
putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the
heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament
of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of
great price" (1 Peter ii, 3, 4); and, "In like manner also,
that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with
shamefacedness and sobriety, not with braided hair or gold
or pearls or costly array, but (which becometh women professing
godliness) with good works." (1 Tim. ii, 9, 10.)
Then I thought: "The child is right. The Bible means just
what it says." Then I recalled that Mrs. Wheaton had told
me how she went one day to visit a poor, sick girl, to whom
she had talked of the love of Christ until she was almost
won. She went again with a wealthy woman, who was
decked with diamonds. As they entered the room, the girl
pointed to the jewels, and said: "O mother, mother! I
have wanted them all my life!" The rich woman tried to
hide her diamonds, and Mrs. Wheaton tried to turn the
girl's attention again to the Savior, but in vain. Her last
thought was of the diamonds, and her last words, "I have
wanted them all my life!"</p>

<p>Sitting there, with this incident fresh in my mind, I quietly
slipped off ring, watch, chain, cuff-buttons, and collar-stud;
and gold, as an adornment, was put away forever.&mdash;<cite>Abbie

Louisville, Ky., Congress of 1903:</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the age of industrial development. On every side
we see colossal enterprises undertaken and prosecuted to
a successful and profitable conclusion.</p>

<p>Great railroad systems span the continent, carrying millions
of passengers and countless tons of freight, with
safety, celerity and dispatch, to the doors of factory, workshop,
store and consumer.</p>

<p>Immense industrial enterprises are constantly being projected,
consolidated and carried on in a manner to excite
the admiration, mayhap, the wonder and fear of mankind.</p>

<p>Colossal financial transactions amaze the minds of those
uninitiated to the magnitude and the intricacies of such
undertakings.</p>

<p>The unexplored recesses of the earth are exploited in a
manner and on a scale heretofore undreamed of and unknown,
and every department of enterprise is carried on
to a degree that distinctly stamps this decade as the acme
of industrial enterprise and achievements, the golden age
of industrial prosperity, and the acquirement of material
improvement and material gain.</p>

<p>If it be asked why such strides have been made along
industrial lines, the answer is that it is due to <small>ORGANIZATION
AND SPECIALIZATION</small>.</p>

<p>The <small>PERSONNEL</small> of the management have devoted
their lives, their talent and their energies to the special
work before them. They have been drilled and educated
along special lines; they have been deaf and blind to outside
matters not relevant to the work in hand, and by close
and careful study, by unceasing and constant labor, care and
effort, having evolved, projected and carried on these immense
enterprises.</p>

<p>The National Prison Congress at its meeting this year is
mindful of the material progress of the country.</p>

<p>This association is equally ambitious along the lines peculiar
to itself to obtain from the various penal institutions
of the country the highest and best results morally, educationally,
reformatively, and as an incident, punitively and
financially.</p>

<p>How shall we keep pace in penal improvements with the
great material progress of the outside world?</p>

<p>The answer necessarily must be, that improvements in our
department of work must come, as they do elsewhere, by
the investigation, the study, the thought and the effort of
those who are in actual control, of those who are in a position
to see, to observe and to know.</p>

<p>In other words, the question as to whether prisons are
to improve, whether their work shall continue to be of a
higher and nobler character, whether we are finally and
forever to break away from the customs of the galleys of
France, the prisons of Hawes in England, of the Mamertine
of Rome and of Rothenburg in Germany, will depend
utterly, entirely and absolutely upon the personnel of the
prison management of the country.</p>

<p>Prof. Henderson, in his admirable address delivered at
the Philadelphia meeting in 1902, on "The Social Position
of the Prison Warden," says: "Some institutions have no
marked qualities; they have walls, cells, machinery, prisoners,
punishments, but no distinct, consistent and rational
policy."</p>

<p>Where this is true it means that the worst possible condition
of affairs exists. Such an institution has the dry
rot. It is managed (or rather mismanaged) by time
servers, too careless to feel the high responsibility devolving
upon them, and too listless to acquaint themselves with the
many opportunities spread before them to improve and
keep pace with the onward march of progress.</p>

<p>Such officers in their abuse, by inaction, of the opportunities
afforded them, commit "Crimes against criminals"
and through them against society.</p>

<p>On the contrary institutions which have distinct features
and characteristics, have them as the result of the careful
investigation, the patient research and thought of those
who are in responsible and actual control, and these characteristics
and features reflect the wisdom and intelligence
of those who have given their energies and their lives to
the special work before them.</p>


<h4>THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.</h4>

<p>In the management of penal institutions a Board of Directors
or of Control is, ordinarily, the nominal head.</p>

<p>By the laws of most states they are supposed to fix the
administration policy, to restrict and define the powers and
duties of the officers in actual and intimate control.</p>

<p>In some institutions they meet a day or so each month,
in most institutions not so frequently. Their duties while
at the institution may or may not be largely perfunctory,
and as they are generally active business men at home in
other channels, the day or two a month or quarter is apt
to be regarded by the unthoughtful as a respite or surcease
from other duties. The main duty of a Board of Directors
or of Control may be said to be the determining of the
general policy upon which the institution shall be conducted,
and a cursory oversight of the conduct of its affairs.</p>


<h4>THE WARDEN.</h4>

<p>The warden or superintendent is the one official who can
give tone, expression and color to the institution. He is
distinctly and positively its actual managing head, and
upon his intelligence, interest, zeal, tact and discretion will
depend, almost entirely, its weal or its woe.</p>

<p>He must be a man of intelligence, and be willing and
anxious to increase his fund of knowledge and information.</p>

<p>He should be a profound student not only of the ordinary
subjects that attract the student, but of prison systems, of
laws, business, government, society as it exists, and of
human nature in all its many phases.</p>


<h4>HE MUST BE AN ORGANIZER.</h4>

<p>No difference how elaborate a system may be found in
any institution of this kind, the warden will always be an
intensely busy and greatly occupied officer.</p>

<p>If he would prevent chaos and confusion and obtain
from every official the highest and best work of which he
is capable, he must organize every department thoroughly.
Every officer and every inmate must know his exact duties,
so far as it is possible to know them, and be made responsible
for those duties and the warden must be enabled to appreciate
a high order of talent and the accomplishment of
good work, and to locate the blame for omissions and short
comings, and provide for their correction.</p>

<p>Thorough system in every detail will conserve the capacities
of all his subordinates and leave him in a measure
free to observe the actual conditions and to plan and to put
into effect improvements along moral, industrial, physical
and financial lines.</p>


<h4>HE MUST BE A FINANCIER.</h4>

<p>The financial question in every prison in the land is an
extremely important one. Funds for prisons are doled out
grudgingly, and the demand for absolutely necessary purposes
is always far greater than the supply.</p>

<p>A warden performs no more important function than
when he sees that the funds of the institution are so used
as to effect the highest possible results, and that all the
forces of the prison are so energized and conserved as to
permit, under ordinary conditions, a satisfactory and proper
earning and economizing power. With the many demands
made upon him for means for increasing the usefulness of
his institution, a high order of financial aptitude is an absolutely
necessary characteristic in a successful warden.</p>


<h4>DISCIPLINE.</h4>

<p>Discipline in a prison is its first requisite. Nothing can
be accomplished until officers and convicts are under its
sway and control.</p>

<p>The warden who would have control of those under him
must himself at all times, be under self control.</p>

<p>The maxim "No one knows how to command who has
not first learned how to obey," is a trite and a true one. The
population of a prison is made up of a heterogeneous collection
of people whose first instincts have been and are,
not to obey.</p>

<p>To bring such people into habits of obedience and control
requires the highest type of skill, tact and discretion.
Punishments and reward must be so blended and combined
as to effect the needful results with the least possible
friction, and in the most humane and rational manner possible.</p>

<p>No warden can afford to delegate the matter of enforcing
discipline entirely or partly, if at all, to another. His first
duty to himself, that he may know actual conditions as they
exist, is to preside over or assist in, the trial of offenders
and to order discipline.</p>

<p>Individual treatment is a necessity in our dealings with
delinquents, and a study of the many phases of delinquency
is a prime requisite in a successful warden's repertoire.</p>

<p>Brainard F. Smith says: "Many a prisoner has been reformed&mdash;or,
if not reformed, made a better prisoner&mdash;by
punishment."</p>

<p>Will the warden have any higher duty to perform than
to face his delinquent delinquents and to order in merciful
severity, rational punishments for their short-comings?</p>

<p>But a warden's disciplinary powers are apt to be taxed
more severely in another direction. The great problem ordinarily,
is not so much the discipline of convicts as that
of subordinate officers. If subordinate officers will obey
the spirit and the letter of the rules, the convict has the
potential influence of a powerful example to aid him.
"Like master like man."</p>

<p>In institutions where officers are appointed solely with
reference to their fitness, comparatively little trouble should
be had in the matter of proper official discipline. But
where places are given to heelers, ward-workers and political
strikers, the matter of efficient discipline is a question
of grave concern to the warden. In the absence of better
material, however, he must address himself to organizing
what he has to the highest efficiency possible, and insist
and require a rigid regimen and adhere to his demands
and requirements with Spartan firmness.</p>


<h4>THE PRISON SCHOOL.</h4>

<p>The educational work of a prison is of the highest, I may
say, of the first importance. The education of the hands
to work comes naturally, partly as an incident of the necessary
work carried on in prison.</p>

<p>Nearly all convicts are densely ignorant. The polished,
scholarly, shrewd criminal of whom we hear so much, and
to whom the papers and books give so much prominence,
is the exception, not the rule, in prison.</p>

<p>If the prison is to have a reformatory feature, it must
come very largely through the school. Many prison schools
are such only in name. The work accomplished is very
meager. The results are very unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>To no part of prison work should a warden address himself
with more ardor and determination than so to organize
the prison school as to make it the great positive factor in
dispelling ignorance and its attendant viciousness, and in
quickening and enlivening the moral sense in those whose
moral judgment is exceedingly obtuse.</p>

<p>The course of study in a prison school is necessarily a
very elementary one, and unless followed by a supplementary
course of reading and study, will be of little permanent
and practical benefit. Many prison libraries, largely
the result of indiscriminate and heterogeneous donations of
all kinds of literature, good, bad and indifferent, chiefly the
latter, are not in a position to be a positive force.</p>

<p>Let the warden see that his library is so arranged, classified
and used as to be a source of information, profit, help
and pleasure to the inmates, and that a course of reading
along rational lines is laid out, encouraged, and, if possible,
adhered to, in order that the preliminary school course may
not have been in vain.</p>


<h4>COURAGE NEEDED.</h4>

<p>The warden must be a man of courage. I do not refer
to the kind of courage necessary to face a regiment of depraved
and wicked men shorn of their power and their
stimulus to do evil, but that high moral courage necessary
to clean the Augean stables of abuses of customs, to reverse
policies of long standing that are nevertheless wrong
in principle and in practice, to fight against unjust, improper
and unwise legislative propositions concerning his
institution; the kind of courage that prompted the chaplain
in Chas. Reade's "<small>NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND</small>," to
fight and destroy the iniquitous prison system of Keeper
Hawes and his minions; the courage that will keep to the
fore-front a persistent opposition to prostituting penitentiaries
into eleemosynary institutions and political cribs and
feeding troughs for political strikers.</p>

<p>He must have the courage to weed out and eliminate useless
barnacles in the shape of incompetent and worthless
employes, and substitute in their stead men of capacity,
character and intelligence, who are in love with their work
and believe in its dignity and usefulness; the courage to
face demagogues in their efforts to take from the prison
its educative, moral, reformatory and economic force, the
right of the unfortunate inmates to learn the gospel of
labor under right and just conditions.</p>


<h4>OPTIMISM NECESSARY.</h4>

<p>The warden needs to be intensely optimistic. He must
have a reserve fund of enthusiasm. He must believe profoundly
in the high character of his office and educate others
constantly to believe in it. The ignorance of the great
mass of the people as to the real function of penitentiaries
and the methods by which they are carried on is amazing
and mortifying to prison officials.</p>

<p>A part of the warden's mission is to acquaint the outside
world with conditions as they exist inside, and to inspire
the interest and support of the general public in
measures for bettering and improving prison conditions.
Legislative bodies especially, need to be brought into closer
relations and the law makers made to realize their duty
to the public and the convict in the enactment of wise,
proper and righteous legislation.</p>

<p>Longfellow, in his beautiful poem, "<small>THE BUILDING OF
THE SHIP</small>," tells why the master builder achieved success.
It was because</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"His heart was in the work and the heart</span>
<span class="i2">Giveth grace to every art."</span>
</div>

<p>The warden's heart must be in his work. His whole soul
must be animated and permeated with an honest and sincere
desire to bring penology up to a higher and nobler
standard.</p>

<p>He must have a reserve force of enthusiasm that will not
be daunted and destroyed by temporary failures or the
lapses of some discharged or pardoned convicts, who, in
spite of care and pains, will return to their evil ways. The
enthusiasm that can bear the harsh and ignorant criticism
and misrepresentations incident to his work; the enthusiasm
that in its contagion will inoculate directors, subordinate
officers, the press and the people with a desire for
more light on penal problems and a purpose to be governed
by that light; the enthusiasm that will beget great
patience for the exacting, difficult and trying problems before
him; that will make him believe that "a convict saved
is a man made"; that will make him believe with the great
English novelist "It is never too late to mend," and that
as infinite care and pains finally brought Robinson, the
twice convicted thief, up to the estate of honest manhood,
so, infinite care and pains should be exerted with every
man under his charge.</p>

<p>Pessimism has no rightful place in a penitentiary. In the
language of Socrates, "Why should we who are never angry
at an ill-conditioned body, always be angry with an ill-conditioned
soul?"</p>

<p>The ignorant Hawes believed in the profitless crank, the
black-hole, the deprivation of food, of bed, of clothing, the
tortures of the waist jacket and the collar, and a sign over
the door, "<small>ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE</small>."</p>

<p>The twentieth century warden believes in the gospel of
productive labor, of education of hand, head and heart, in
the deprivation of privileges, largely as punishment, the
segregation of the desperate and nearly hopeless, the enlightenment
of an all-powerful, all potential, all influential
example and the motto of Pope Clement, "It is of little
advantage to restrain criminals by punishment unless you
reform them with training and teaching."</p>


<h4>THE CHAPLAIN.</h4>

<p>The chaplain occupies an extremely important but delicate
position in prison management. It is possible for him
to be of vast influence and power for good.</p>

<p>The chaplain needs to be a man of large heart, aided by
an abundance of sound common sense. He needs to bear
in mind constantly, in the difficult and delicate work he is
called upon to perform, that the discipline of the prison
must be upheld and enforced.</p>

<p>Associate officers are frequently disturbed with the fear
that the chaplain's influence will subvert the discipline of
the prison; that the shrewd, unprincipled convicts by pouring
into his ears their imaginary tales of woe, may succeed
in working him.</p>

<p>The chaplain's first requirement, if he would succeed, is
not to lose sight of the majesty of the law and of the
prison rules.</p>

<p>The chaplain and the warden should go hand in hand,
the one sustaining the other. They need to have a perfect
understanding, neither mistrusting the other. Frequent
conferences ought to enable them to proceed along proper
lines. The chaplain's opportunities are limitless. I do not
undertake to say what direction his duties shall take him.
That will be discussed fully in the Chaplain's Association.</p>

<p>It is personal, individual work that counts in a prison.
All the chaplain's work should be thought out beforehand,
be methodical, premeditated, intentional, systematic and
thorough. His chapel service should be rational, of the
proper length, with exercises, song service and preaching
service carefully chosen. There should be no room in a
prison service for the spectacular, the highly emotional and
the haphazard sermons and addresses of a chance visitor.
A reasonably rigid censorship ought to be exercised over
the contributions of outsiders to the chapel service.</p>

<p>The influence of sight seers and idle visitors to prisons,
always bad, reaches the acme of its perniciousness in the
chapel service, if unrestrained and unguided by prison officials
of experience and firmness, who alone are in a position
to know that sickly sentimentality is the worst possible
pabulum to offer men already too eager to justify
their evil deeds.</p>


<h4>THE PHYSICIAN.</h4>

<p>A physician's duties in a prison are necessarily onerous,
important and difficult. Convicts are constantly claiming
that they are unable physically to do the work assigned
them. No one can determine the truthfulness of their
statements except the physician, and to determine whether
the convict is really ill or exercising his usual finesse to
shirk his duties, requires keen judgment of human nature
as well as an accurate knowledge of his profession.</p>

<p>The convict, housed and hemmed in, is peculiarly susceptible
to hallucinations and to thinking that he is afflicted
with imaginary ills.</p>

<p>A physician needs a large fund of good judgment, will-power
and common sense to combat successfully with this
class of people. How far he should use some of the subterfuges
supposed to be employed by physicians in the outside
world in dealing with people afflicted with hypochondria,
I am unable to say, but a certain amount of cheerfulness
coupled with firmness is undoubtedly of great value.</p>


<h4>SUBORDINATE OFFICERS.</h4>

<p>The subordinate officers of a prison are very important
factors in the management of a prison. They come in
actual, continual, personal contact with the men.</p>

<p>No difference how capable and zealous may be the
warden and his deputy, unless they have men of character,
zeal, intelligence and discretion to carry out their orders
and wishes faithfully and well, all their plans will come to
naught.</p>

<p>Guards, keepers and watchmen should be of good moral
character. It is useless to talk about reforming convicts
unless they have continually the benefit of good examples
set before them. Precept amounts to nothing unless re-enforced
by good examples.</p>

<p>They should be educated and intelligent.</p>

<p>Their duties are largely discretionary, and in their contact
with convicts a high order of intelligence is necessary
to know the right thing to do. Strict integrity and truthfulness
are prime requisites. An officer's word should be
beyond question and he should be absolutely impartial in
his dealings with his men.</p>

<p>No special system will bring the highest results with any
kind of men behind it. Any system with men of character,
conscience and capacity will achieve great good. Any system
with men of bad character, ignorant, careless and indifferent,
will fall to the ground.</p>

<p>A common impression prevails that any one is good
enough for a prison guard, and if he is too old, too feeble
and decrepit or too lazy for other work, his political strikers
will try to unload him on the penitentiary authorities.</p>

<p>Prison Directors, Wardens and all in authority should set
their faces resolutely against this erroneous and terribly
harmful idea. Partisan politics should not be a factor in
the appointment or the retention of any prison officer. All
subordinates should be appointed under civil service rules
and be required to pass a civil service examination, and
after entering upon his duties be required to take up a
course of study on penological questions and problems and
be otherwise carefully schooled and drilled along the lines
of their work. If time demonstrates their unfitness for the
position they should be summarily removed. If they manifest
an aptitude and an interest in their work they should
be encouraged, promoted and protected against removal
for partisan reasons.</p>

<p>Whenever directors in banks are elected with reference
to their political proclivities and not with reference to
their business sagacity, it will be proper to select prison
officials for the same reason.</p>

<p>Whenever great business firms discharge their managers
because their political views do not coincide with those of
the owners, then and not till then should prison officials
step down and out for political reasons.</p>

<p>What would be thought of directors of a business enterprise
or the regents of a university who selected their business
manager, their teachers, with regard to their views
on finance or on the tariff, or who would remove a faithful,
efficient and capable servant after years of experience in
his work, merely because he did not coincide with the political
views of the majority of his directors in a matter in
no way germane to his work?</p>

<p>As Boards of Directors spend but a small percentage of
their time at the institutions they control, it necessarily takes
them years to get a clear insight into all the details of its
work, and to make a change just when, through the process
of time, the director becomes fitted for his work, is the
height of unwisdom and folly. Boards of Charity and Correction
having charge of all the institutions in the State
would certainly be much more desirable. Such officers
could devote their entire time and attention to the work,
and thus be able to give all the institutions of the State uniform
treatment and attention. Boards of Directors or of
Control should be appointed and reappointed as long as they
are efficient and manifest an interest in the work.</p>

<p>And so with all other officers from the warden down,
and each should feel and know that faithfulness and efficiency
is the only standard, and that they would not be expected,
required or permitted to weaken their influence or
their energies by undue or active participations in political
effort or political manipulations.</p>

<p>The surest sign of unfitness for prison work and lack
of interest in the work is an undue activity in political caucuses
and conventions. The official practically advertises
that he cannot hope to hold his place on account of his efficiency,
but expects to do so because of his services as a
political henchman.</p>


<h4>THE DEMANDS OF THE AGE.</h4>

<p>As this age demands a high order of talent and effort in
the industrial, so it should demand and require great ability
and power in the penal world.</p>

<p>The third of a century of the life of the National Prison
Congress has witnessed great progress in the domain over
which it has advisory power. Many problems pressing
for solution demand the highest functions of those in control.</p>

<p>Do punishments deter men from crime?</p>

<p>Do the universal customs of the times foster and beget
much of the crime committed?</p>

<p>Does war beget murder elsewhere?</p>

<p>Is social vengeance a failure, and are other means necessary
to prevent crime?</p>

<p>Should not executives now clothed with power to terminate
or shorten sentences of imprisonment also have
power to lengthen terms of imprisonment or to change
from a definite to an indefinite term whenever they become
in possession of facts regarding the convict's previous life
or present character, which were unknown to the sentencing
judge?</p>

<p>Should not United States prisoners incarcerated in the
various state prisons have the restrictions of the indeterminate
sentence and the parole, thus securing a uniform
system of treatment for all prisoners and greatly promoting
the discipline?</p>

<p>Should we go back of the commission of crimes and ascertain
if the State itself is not committing a crime in imposing
and permitting conditions that beget crime?</p>

<p>Should not the pardoning power be exercised frequently
before the convicted man ever reaches the prison at all?
Could not many a man be saved by being put on probation
from the start, who otherwise would be in great danger
of being lost?</p>

<p>Does the discipline of prisons have anything to do with
the commission of offenses by convicts when released?
Does the enforced restraint exerted to the very last moment
of his release and then wholly relaxed, cause the released
convict to swing to the other extreme like Jean
Valjean, who after nineteen years of imprisonment for stealing
a loaf of bread and an attempt to escape, robbed his
benefactor, the Bishop, of his plate, and upon being forgiven
robbed little Gervais of his forty sou piece, but afterward
got his bearings, attained his balance and lived an honorable
life?</p>

<p>Should any prisoner ever be released at the prison door,
or should he not for his own sake as well as society's be required
to live a period on probation and under oversight,
subject to return for violations; in other words, should not
paroles be, under proper restrictions, the universal and only
rule?</p>

<p>To the solution of these and countless other problems let
the highest order of talent, the best combination of head,
heart and brain be summoned: let every prison be a school
for study and investigation, and be engineered and controlled
by men of skill, drilled and educated along these lines, and
who are animated by a desire to contribute their full share
towards the upbuilding and uplifting of the race and the
amelioration of the woes that beset mankind.</p>

<p class="center"><small>PREFACE.</small></p>

<blockquote><p>To any one who may read these lines I will say: Do not
criticise; I know you will find many mistakes, but I hope
you will remember they are written by one who has not had

</p></blockquote>

<p>I often wonder if the busy world ever gives a thought to
the men incarcerated in places made for the punishment of
crime and reformation of criminals, but often failing of
reaching the desired result. Why is this failure? It must
be from defect in the law or prison discipline. Some think
perhaps the rigid enforcement of the law in its severest
way is right, and that the prisoner should be shown no
mercy. But this is wrong in every detail and should be just
the reverse, so far as consistent with good order and discipline.</p>

<p>A judge in sentencing a prisoner should give a sentence
consistent with justice and mercy, regardless of public sentiment,
considering his own judgment, and not the possible
consequences of his act on his future. Until this is more
generally practiced, I am afraid there will be many too severe
sentences passed on minor criminals and first offenders,
as now, which will work to the injury of the convicted instead
of his reformation. In my humble opinion, one year
would give the lesson desired to many a novice in crime
who is now serving from three to ten years. It should be
remembered that short sentences give a novice in crime a
wholesome dread of the law and fear of prison life, while
custom and association with criminals tend to harden. The
cases of old offenders, require more severity as regards
time of confinement. Nor can we say to the jurors&mdash;or,
rather, gentlemen of the jury&mdash;be very careful of what you
do. Don't treat the trust you have in charge too lightly;
give it all the consideration you are masters of. Remember
you have the liberty, and, perhaps the life, of your fellowman
at stake. Be very careful of what you do. Allow
no personal motive to interfere with your duty, for, if we believe
in the Bible, those who do so will answer in the hereafter
for actions in this life. Beware, then, of how you
mete out justice to your fellowman. Do unto others as you
would have others do unto you. Weigh well the evidence
given against the prisoner. If you find that there is a motive
on the part of the witnesses to convict the prisoner being
tried, you may rest assured they will trifle with the truth.
In such cases a juror should try and put himself in the defendant's
place and try to assume his feelings and condition,
as much as possible, and see how he would act in a like
case. If all jurors would do this, I think they would give
a just and true verdict in nearly all cases. But I fear as
things are now they let the press have too much weight
with the rendering of a just verdict, and it may be of what
their friends will say to them if they have a different opinion.
Yet the man who does such a thing is a coward, a devil
incarnate, and unfit to be at large. Such action may be the
cause of making a criminal out of a so far really honest
man. May God forgive them who recklessly tamper with
the liberty of their fellowman. Some may think I am not
for punishment of crime. If so, they are wrong. I believe
in punishment of crime. But I believe in tempering justice
with mercy. There should be no lingering doubt in a person's
mind when he gives his verdict against the prisoner.
It is a very easy thing to place a man in prison, but oh! so
hard to get him out. A lie sworn to and believed is one of
the hardest things in the world to get righted. And I know
from personal experience what it is. Though it seems hard
to say a lie is more readily believed against a person charged
with a crime than the truth, yet it seems easier to a great
many to believe bad rather than good of their neighbor.
Yet, thank God, it is not so with all. We have many noble
and true Christians yet in this vale of tears&mdash;gentlemen and
ladies who practice what they say by many kindly acts to
the poor, unhappy men who are unfortunate enough to get
behind prison bars. God bless them for such acts. It does
not hurt them, and gives to the unhappy prisoner a little happiness&mdash;a
ray of sunshine through the clouds that surround
him. Continue your noble work. You will be the gainer
in the end, from the knowledge that you have done in the
Lord's work, if in no other way. Oh, could you see the
happiness beam from the eyes of some of those here, after
the call of some who take friendly interest in them, you
would know the good they are doing. Others seem to say:
Oh, well, I am forgotten by all. Poor heart; what a sad lot.
It would seem the sooner that death ended their misery the
better. But while there is life there is hope. I must say
that many ladies of C&mdash;&mdash; are very kind in giving up their
own pleasures on Sundays that prisoners in this prison may
have some little change in their life. The visiting chaplains
always bring a choir with them, and to them we give our
heartfelt thanks, with a God bless you. I love to read of
the progress made in these penal institutions where reform
is practiced. I am sure the prisoners must take an interest
in it all, for it is all for their own good. The Stillwater
prison and Elmira prison must be models of neatness and
good order, with a perfect system of discipline. It would
be well for all prisons to copy them. If prisons are supposed
to be erected for the purpose of reformation, why
not make them in reality what they are intended to be? Of
course, there are many different kinds of crime committed
by men of different temperaments, all of which are thoroughly
understood, or as nearly as possible. For example,
take the greatest crime committed in the eyes of the law&mdash;murder&mdash;which
is often called murder when there is no
ground for it. The public outcry when one man is unfortunate
enough to take the life of another at a time when he
may have every reason to believe his own life is in the greatest
danger. The cry is raised by some one, possibly an eye-witness&mdash;Murder!
It is taken up by the press and conveyed
to every one, and possibly a slight coloring given to it. The
people believe it all. The consequence is the public mind is
prejudiced against the prisoner, and it takes a great amount
of proof by the defendant to change that belief, and should
he not be able to produce this evidence, in spite of all he
can say he is convicted of the crime of murder, when in
reality he is guilty of manslaughter, if anything. For, no
matter how truthful a man he may be known to be, his
word, unsustained by evidence, is not accepted; while, on
the other side, no matter how untruthful a witness be known
to be, he is given credit for the truth. What kind of a state
of affairs is this? No wonder we often hear the cry go up
from some poor wounded or crushed heart saying: O, God,
is there no mercy left in man? Is humanity wholly dead?
Must death overtake me here? Shunned I am by all whom
I once called friends&mdash;wife, children, it may be a brother&mdash;but
never by a mother, God bless her.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at this class of sufferers. What will
we find them? Idle? No. They are as a rule men attending
to their work and submitting to all the courtesies of
life, only asking the same in return. Surely, such cannot
be very bad men, who, hearing the cry of distress, respond
at once to the appeal. I know some such to have a heart as
tender as a woman. Yet you will shut them up, it may be
forever. Don't understand me to say that murder is not
committed. Of course it is, and the law should deal with
it accordingly. All true men regret the taking of human
life, even on the field of battle. How much more so under
other circumstances? And the causes are many which make
men do this; some of them hard to understand, may be. In
many cases of this kind they deserve punishment and should
be punished. But, for God's sake, let the punishment be
consistent with justice and mercy. If ten years is not sufficient
punishment to make man control himself in future,
why not be merciful and kill him at once? For as we hope
for mercy, so must we show it to others. All other crimes
should be dealt with accordingly. Give a man a chance to
reclaim himself. Should he return to a life of crime in preference
to an honest one, the law has its remedy and can act
accordingly. This is well worth a trial, and by all means
should be given one. But I hear some one who never gave
these things a thought say: How is this to be done? I will
answer, Very easily, if it receive the support of our legislative
body, by the recommendation of the state governor.
Provide your prisons with workshops of different kinds&mdash;provide
them with schools, and teach the prisoners how to
make a living by some useful trade. Give them a chance
to improve themselves by an education. Make the prison
a place of reformation, one of improvement as well as punishment,
and instead of increasing crime you will reduce it,
which should be the aim of all having the good of their fellowman
at heart, and society will be the gainer. I would
give a prisoner who would show by his conduct a spirit of
reform a parole after half of his time, with conditions attached,
as is done in the Minnesota state prison, so that,
should he fall back into his old way of living, he would be
returned to prison to serve out the remainder of his sentence.
By this means you to all intents and purposes hold
a power over him, and he will be very careful as to what he
is about. This habit in time will grow upon him and be the
cause of making him a good citizen and trustworthy member
of society. To men serving life sentences I would, on
the recommendation of the prison warden, give a parole
after manslaughter sentence has been served. This is a
class of men that deserve some looking after by the kindly
interest of humane persons. Give them hope and encouragement.
Do not leave them to their own morbid thoughts;
you cannot tell what drove them to an act they will regret,
whether in or out of prison. If hasty once, it is no reason
to suppose they will be so again. Why not, then, look after
them? Let some of you Christian people talk with them,
and if you find they ought to be assisted, help them. You
know not what good you may do, and without such aid a
poor and friendless man in prison is without hope. Will
you, as Christians, let him die believing the word Christianity
a mockery? God forbid. I know there are many
good Christians that feel and mean what they say. But I
am afraid that many of the less courageous are deterred
from doing all they would like to do by the sneers of the
hard, cruel world. But this should only spur you on. If
you feel you are right, push on; do not stop half way.</p>

<p>In connection with the parole law we should have our
prisoners graded as first, second and third class, giving to
the second grade or class advantages above the third, and to
the first above the second, giving them a motive to reform
their ways while yet in prison, and their partial liberty from
the first class by parole. By this means you instill into the
prisoner a habit for good which in time will take root and
prove a blessing, not only to the prisoner, but also a source
of pleasure to those bringing it about. It must be expected
that some will fall again; but why should the many suffer
for the few? I have heard and read such sayings as this:
The worst men are the best behaved while in prison if there
is anything to be gained by it. I dispute this. No man can
control or hide his real nature for any great length of time.
Nature is bound to come to the surface sooner or later. The
officers and guards of a prison should be men strict in the
enforcement of the prison rules, humane and just in all their
actions, men who by their own actions and deportment will
gain and hold the respect of those under their charge. They
should reward the good as well as punish the evil in men.
It would, in my humble opinion, be nothing but true justice
to the prisoner to put the whole power of pardoning, commuting
and paroling prisoners in the hands of the governor.
I do not say a judge will not give justice where clemency
is asked. But it may be the case that a judge on the board
of pardons has sentenced the prisoner, and probably in some
way became prejudiced against the applicant, and it might
be the cause of influencing his vote; consequently, it would
look like a piece of injustice to the prisoner to allow that
judge to sit on his case. I think it would be well for a governor
to make himself perfectly acquainted with all pertaining
to the mode of life of the prisoners, as much as possible.
It ought to be remembered that when the prison doors close
on a man your duty is only half done to yourself, the prisoner
and society at large. He needs looking after mentally,
morally and physically. Do not leave him to his own morbid
thoughts, but help him to forget his surroundings as much
as possible. Give him hope, for without hope we are lost
to ourselves and the world. It is possible some will say they
ought to be; but it must be a very heartless person who
makes this remark. Remember, while you are walking about
to-day, feeling self-conscious of your own strength to resist
any and everything in the line of temptation, the time
may come when you will lose control of yourself; or, it may
be, some one dear to you will fall. In such cases, how many
excuses you can find for yourself or him. Can you find
none for those now suffering for the same? I feel impelled
by some power to speak of those very people in a few lines.
Perhaps it may catch their eye. Why will you follow one
to prison with hate, malice and persecution, one who would
not harm a single hair of your head, one who never had or
has a single bitter thought against you, one that nightly
asks God's protection to you and yours? And yet you persecute
him, or it may be them, with all the might you can.
Is it not enough that he has lost home, friends, wife, children
and happiness at one false move? Is it not enough
that he is condemned to a living death, hearing every hour
of the day the clang of the iron bars that shut him out from
the world, that separate him from all he loves? I say to
you, is this not enough to satisfy the most bitter feelings of
any avowed enemy? It ought to be. Yes, this ought to satisfy
you without trying to obliterate the memory of the
father from the child's heart and without denying him the
privilege of communicating with them; without denying
him the pleasure of doing something for them and of one
day seeing them, which is all he has left to live for. To all
to whom these lines refer, who read them, I will say, change
all this. Ask God's help to give you strength to do right.
In time you will feel a restful peace come to you, and it will
make you content, if not happy. Try this, and may God in
his mercy show you the way. And to all prisoners who may
be suffering from the persecution of injustice by others, I
will say the same. Say with all your heart: God forgive
them, they know not what they do. And you will always
find a comfort in helping one another. For as we hope to be
forgiven, so must we forgive. What use in saying the
Lord's prayer&mdash;Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us? We must consider well
the meaning of those lines, and if we cannot or do not comply
with all they mean it is better for us not to use them. I
thank God from my heart, I can say I forgive all my enemies.
I have nothing but a kindly feeling for all mankind.
I do not mean to say that I am not ruffled at times, for I
am; I would not be human if I were not.</p>

<p>There is one class of men who come to prison that should
command the attention of our lawmakers&mdash;namely, married
men. Not on their own account, for they should pay the
penalty of the law as well as another, but on account of their
families. It must be remembered that when you take away
the father and supporter of a family you leave them without
the means of support; and if the mother happens to be
a sick and weakly person, what is to become of them?</p>

<p>To be sure, we have the orphans' home and the alms-house,
but this is only taxing more heavily the already over-burdened
taxpayers of the country. Then it would be a
commendable act of the legislative bodies to enact laws to
provide for the improvement of such married men and give
the earnings of their labor to their families. This, to me,
looks reasonable and just, and easy of accomplishment, and
should be acted upon by all means. Let me draw you a picture
from my imagination: We will visit a family who are in
easy circumstances these cold nights. What do we see?
Well-clad and well-fed children, a happy, contented look
rests upon the wife's and husband's faces. Why should it
not be so? They have plenty to eat and wear; a full bin of
coal. Again, visit one where the husband may be languishing
behind the prison bars, but of the same class. It is not
so cheerful, but still no want is felt, and the father and husband,
although chafing at confinement, feels that his family
is not in want. This, of course, will be a consolation to him.
Now let us visit another house, where they have always lived
from hand to mouth. The father is gone. The mother and
children, poor souls, ill-clad, ill-fed, and, my God, it may be,
no fire. What a picture to contemplate. It makes me shudder
to think of it. Now come with me behind the prison
bars and see the head of this family. Knowing the want and
needs of his family, and knowing how impossible it is for
him to alleviate their suffering, it is enough to drive a man
insane. But, on the other hand, if this man could earn
something for his family's support, it would relieve his mind
of a heavy burden. Think well of this, and in the name of
God change the law that certainly works contrary to what it
was intended for. As it now stands, you simply provide
punishment for the criminals. In so doing you cause untold
suffering and shame to innocent ones. In God's name, let
it cease to be so. Now, then, for fear I may tire the reader,
I will close.</p>

<blockquote><p>"And being in an agony, He prayed."&mdash;St. Luke 22:44.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the last supper was over, and the last hymn had
been sung, our Lord and His Apostles&mdash;with the one traitor
fatally absent from their number&mdash;went out of the city gate,
and down the steep valley of the Kidron to the green slope
of Olivet beyond it. Solemn and sad was that last walk together;
and a weight of mysterious awe sank like lead upon
the hearts of those few poor Galileans as in almost unbroken
silence,&mdash;through the deep hush of the Oriental night,&mdash;through
the dark shadows of the ancient olive-trees,&mdash;through
the broken gleams of the Paschal moonlight,&mdash;they
followed Him, their Lord and Master, who, with bowed
head and sorrowing heart, walked before them to His willing
doom.</p>

<p>That night they did not return as usual to Bethany, but
stopped at the little familiar garden of Gethsemane, or "the
oilpress." Jesus knew that the hour of His uttermost humiliation
was near,&mdash;that from this moment till the utterance
of that great cry which broke His heart, nothing remained
for Him on earth, save all that the human frame can tolerate
of torturing pain, and all that the human soul can bear
of poignant anguish&mdash;till in that torment of body and
desolation of soul, even the high and radiant serenity of
His divine spirit should suffer a short but terrible eclipse.
One thing alone remained before that short hour began;
a short space was left Him, and in that space He had to
brace His body, to nerve His soul, to calm His spirit by
prayer and solitude, until all that is evil in the power of evil
should wreak its worst upon His innocent and holy head.
And He had to face that hour,&mdash;to win that victory,&mdash;as all
the darkest hours must be faced, as all the hardest victories
must be won&mdash;alone. It was not that He was above the
need of sympathy,&mdash;no noble soul is;&mdash;and perhaps the
noblest need it most. Though His friends did but sleep,
while the traitor toiled, yet it helped Him in His hour of
darkness to feel at least that they were near and that those
were nearest who loved Him most. "Stay here," He said
to the little group, "while I go yonder and pray." Leaving
them to sleep, each wrapped in his outer garment on the
grass, He took Peter and James and John, the chosen of the
chosen, and went about a stone's-throw off. But soon even
<em>their</em> presence was more than He could endure. A grief
beyond utterance, a struggle beyond endurance, a horror
of great darkness, overmastered Him, as with the sinking
swoon of an anticipated death. He must be yet more alone,
and alone with God. Reluctantly He tore Himself away
from their sustaining tenderness, and amid the dark-brown
trunks of those gnarled trees withdrew from the moonlight
into the deeper shade, where solitude might be for Him the
audience-chamber of His Heavenly Father. And there,
till slumber overpowered them, His three beloved Apostles
were conscious how dreadful was the paroxysm through
which He passed. They saw Him sometimes with head
bowed upon His knees, sometimes lying on His face in prostrate
suffering upon the ground. And though amazement
and sore distress fell on them,&mdash;though the whole place
seemed to be haunted by Presences of good and evil struggling
in mighty but silent contest for the eternal victory,&mdash;yet,
before they sank under the oppression of troubled slumber,
they knew that they had been the dim witnesses of an
unutterable agony, in which the drops of anguish which
dropped from His brow in that deathful struggle looked to
them like gouts of blood, and yet the burden of those broken
murmurs in which He pleaded with His Heavenly Father
had been ever this, "If it be possible,&mdash;yet not what I will,
but what Thou wilt."</p>

<p>What is the meaning, my beloved sister, of this scene for
us? What was the cause of this midnight hour? Do you
think that it was the fear of death, and that that was sufficient
to shake to its utmost center the pure and innocent
soul of the Son of Man? Could not even a child see how
inconsistent such a fear would be with all that followed;&mdash;with
that heroic fortitude which fifteen consecutive hours
of sleepless agony could not disturb;&mdash;with that majestic
silence which overawed even the hard Roman into respect
and fear;&mdash;with that sovereign ascendency of soul which
flung open the golden gate of Paradise to the repentant
malefactor, and breathed its compassionate forgiveness on
the apostate priest? Could He have been afraid of death,
in whose name, and in whose strength, and for whose sake
alone, trembling old men, and feeble maidens, and timid
boys have faced it in its worst form without a shudder or a
sigh? My friend, the dread of the mere act of dying is a
cowardice so abject that the meanest passions of the mind
can master it, and many a coarse criminal has advanced to
meet his end with unflinching confidence and steady step.
And Jesus knew, if any have ever known, that it is as natural
to die as to be born,&mdash;that it is the great birthright of
all who love God;&mdash;that it is God who giveth His beloved
sleep. The sting of death&mdash;and its only sting&mdash;is sin; the
victory of the grave&mdash;and its only victory&mdash;is corruption.
And Jesus knew no sin, saw no corruption. No, that which
stained His forehead with crimson drops was something far
deadlier than death. Though sinless He was suffering for
sin. The burden and the mystery of man's strange and
revolting wickedness lay heavy on His soul; and with holy
lips He was draining the bitter cup into which sin had infused
its deadliest poison. Could perfect innocence endure
without a shudder all that is detestable in human ingratitude
and human rage? Should there be no recoil of horror in the
bosom of perfect love to see His own,&mdash;for whom he came,&mdash;absorbed
in one insane repulsion against infinite purity
and tenderness and peace? It was a willing agony, but it
was agony; it was endured for our sakes; the Son of God
suffered that He might through suffering become perfect
in infinite sympathy as a Savior strong to save.</p>

<p>And on all the full mysterious meaning of that agony
and bloody sweat it would be impossible now to dwell, but
may we not for a short time dwell with profit&mdash;may not
every one whose heart&mdash;being free from the fever of passion,
and unfretted by the pettiness of pride&mdash;is calm and
meek and reverent enough to listen to the messages of God,
even be they spoken by the feeblest of human lips,&mdash;may we
not all, I say, learn something from this fragment of that
thrilling story that&mdash;"being in an agony, He prayed"?</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The chosen three, on mountain height,</span>
<span class="i1">While Jesus bowed in prayer,</span>
<span class="i0">Beheld His vesture glow with light,</span>
<span class="i1">His face shine wondrous fair."</span>
</div>

<p>To every one of us, I suppose, sooner or later the Gethsemane
of life must come. It may be the Gethsemane of
struggle, and poverty and care;&mdash;it may be the Gethsemane
of long and weary sickness;&mdash;it may be the Gethsemane of
farewells that wring the heart by the deathbeds of those we
love;&mdash;it may be the Gethsemane of remorse, and of well-nigh
despair, for sins that we will not&mdash;but which we say
we cannot&mdash;overcome. Well, my dearest sister, in that
Gethsemane&mdash;aye, even in that Gethsemane of sin&mdash;no angel
merely,&mdash;but Christ Himself who bore the burden of our
sins,&mdash;will, if we seek Him, come to comfort us. He will,
if being in agony, we pray. He can be touched, He is
touched, with the feeling of our infirmities. He, too, has
trodden the winepress of agony alone; He, too, has lain face
downwards in the night upon the ground; and the comfort
which then came to Him He has bequeathed to us&mdash;even
the comfort, the help, the peace, the recovery, the light,
the hope, the faith, the sustaining arm, the healing anodyne
of prayer. It is indeed a natural comfort&mdash;and one to which
the Christian at least flies instinctively. When the water-floods
drown us,&mdash;when all God's waves and storms seem to
be beating over our souls,&mdash;when "Calamity comes like a
deluge, and o'erfloods our crimes till sin is hidden in sorrow"&mdash;oh,
then, if we have not wholly quenched all spiritual
life within us, what can we do but fling ourselves at the
foot of those great altar stairs that slope through darkness
to God? Yes, being in an agony, we pray; and the talisman
against every agony is there.</p>

<p>And herein lies the great mercy and love of God, that
we may go to Him in our agony even if we have never gone
before. Oh, if prayer were possible only for the always
good and always true, possible only for those who have
never forsaken or forgotten God,&mdash;if it were not possible
for sinners and penitents and those who have gone astray,&mdash;then
of how infinitely less significance would it be for
sinful and fallen man! But our God is a God of Love, a
God of Mercy. He is very good to us. The soul may
come bitter and disappointed, with nothing left to offer
Him but the dregs of a misspent life;&mdash;the soul may come,
like that sad Prodigal, weary and broken, and shivering,
and in rags; but if it only come&mdash;the merciful door is open
still, and while yet we are a great way off our Father will
meet and forgive and comfort us. And then what a change
is there in our lives! They are weak no longer; they are
discontented no longer; they are the slaves of sin no longer.
You have seen the heavens gray with dull and leaden-colored
clouds, you have seen the earth chilly and comfortless
under its drifts of unmelting snow: but let the sun shine,
and then how rapidly does the sky resume its radiant blue,
and the fields laugh with green grass and vernal flower!
So will it be with even a withered and a wasted life when
we return to God and suffer Him to send His bright beams
of light upon our heart. I do not mean that the pain or
misery under which we are suffering will necessarily be removed,&mdash;even
for Christ it was not so; but peace will come
and strength will come and resignation will come and hope
will come,&mdash;and we shall feel able to bear anything which
God shall send, and though He slays us we still shall seek
Him, and even if the blackest cloud of anguish seem to
shroud His face from us, even on that cloud shall the rainbow
shine.</p>

<p>You do not think, my sister, that because God never rejects
the prayer of sinner or sufferer, that therefore we may
go on sinning, trusting to repent when we suffer. That
would be a shameful abuse of God's mercy and tenderness;
it would be a frame of mind which would need this solemn
warning, that agony by no means always leads to prayer;
that it may come when prayer is possible no longer to the
long-hardened and long-prayerless soul. I know no hope
so senseless, so utterly frustrated by all experience, as the
hope of what is called deathbed repentance. Those who are
familiar with many deathbeds will tell you why. But
prayer&mdash;God's blessed permission to us, to see Him and to
know Him, and to trust in Him&mdash;<em>that</em> is granted us not for
the hours of death or agony alone, but for all life, almost
from the very cradle quite to the very grave. And it is a
gift no less priceless for its alleviation of sorrow than for
its intensification of all innocent joy. For him who would
live a true life it is as necessary in prosperity as in adversity,&mdash;in
peace as in trouble,&mdash;in youth as in old
age. Here, too, Christ is our example. He lived,
as we may live, in the light of His Father's face. It
was not only as the Man of Sorrows, it was not only in the
moonlit garden of His agony, or on the darkening hills of
His incessant toil, that prayer had refreshed His soul; but
often during those long unknown years in the little Galilean
village,&mdash;daily, and from childhood upwards, in sweet
hours of peace, kneeling amid the mountain lilies or on the
cottage floor. Those prayers are to the soul what the dew
of God is to the flowers of the field; the burning wind of the
day may pass over them, and the stems droop and the colors
fade, but when the dew steals down at evening, they will
revive. Why should not that gracious dew fall even now
and always for all of us upon the fields of life? A life
which has been from the first a life of prayer,&mdash;a life which
has thus from its earliest days looked up consciously to its
Father and its God,&mdash;will always be a happy life. Time
may fleet, and youth may fade,&mdash;as they will, and there may
be storm as well as sunshine in the earthly career; yet it will
inevitably be a happy career, and with a happiness that cannot
die. Yes, this is the lesson which I would that we all
might learn from the thought of Christ in the garden of
Gethsemane;&mdash;the lesson that Prayer may recall the sunshine
even to the dark and the frozen heart; but that there
is no long winter, there is no unbroken night, to that soul on
which the Sun of Righteousness has risen with healing in
His wings.</p>

<p>And that because true prayer is always heard. We read
in the glorious old Greek poet of prayers which, before they
reached the portals of heaven were scattered by the winds;
and indeed there are some prayers so deeply opposed to the
will of God, so utterly alien to the true interests of men,
that nothing could happen better for us than that God
should refuse, nothing more terrible than that He should
grant them in anger. So that if we pray for any earthly
blessing we may pray for it solely "if it be God's will"; "if
it be for our highest good," but, for all the best things we
may pray without misgiving, without reservation, certain
that if we ask God will grant them. Nay, even in asking
for them we may know that we have them,&mdash;for what we
desire to ask, and what we ask, we aim at, and what we aim
at we shall attain. No man ever yet asked to be, as the
days pass by, more noble, and sweet, and pure, and heavenly-minded,&mdash;no
man ever yet prayed that the evil spirits of
hatred, and pride, and passion, and worldliness, might be
cast out of his soul,&mdash;without his petition being granted,
and granted to the letter. And with all other gifts God then
gives us His own self besides,&mdash;He makes us know Him,
and love Him, and live in Him. "Thou hast written well of
me," said the Vision to the great teacher of Aquinum, "what
reward dost thou desire?" "Non aliam, nisi te Domine"&mdash;"no
other than Thyself, O Lord," was the meek and rapt
reply. And when all our restless, fretful, discontented longings
are reduced to this alone, the desire to see God's face;&mdash;when
we have none in Heaven but Him, and none upon
earth whom we desire in comparison of Him;&mdash;then we are
indeed happy beyond the reach of any evil thing, for then
we have but one absorbing wish, and that wish cannot be refused.
Least of all can it be refused when it has pleased
God to afflict us.</p>

<p>"Ye now have sorrow," said Christ, "but I will see you
again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man
taketh from you." Yes, when God's children pass under
the shadows of the Cross of Calvary they know that through
that shadow lies their passage to the Great White Throne.
For them Gethsemane is as Paradise. God fills it with sacred
presences; its solemn silence is broken by the music of
tender promises; its awful darkness softened and brightened
by the sunlight of heavenly faces, and the music of angel
wings.</p>

<p>Including an account of the Greatest Revivals
since Pentecostal Days, and telling how
to bring about an old time revival. Also
recording many remarkable answers to prayer.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>MAKE MONEY AND DO GOOD</strong></p>

<p>By selling good books that the people want. The
first edition of 10,000 copies of this new book is
already selling rapidly and is doing great good.
It will attract both saint and sinner. Some of the
old time sermons that moved the multitudes
toward God, like men slain in battle, until their
cries seemed to rend the very heavens, are recorded
in this book. The description of sin and depravity,
of hell and the judgment, by such men as
Edwards, Bunyan, Fletcher, Whitfield, Finney,
Caughey, Finley, and many others, will
waken the slumbering conscience and reveal the
wrath of God against sin and this evil generation.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>FROM TESTIMONIALS RECEIVED, WE SELECT A FEW.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Michigan Presbyterian:</b> "A mine of
gold. Thoroughly practical. Intensely
interesting. It will stir the soul."</p>

<p><b>The Way of Faith:</b> "In this timely
book the author discusses 'Old Time
Views of Sin and Depravity,' 'Old
Time Conviction and Repentance,'
'Old Time Conversion,' and so on
through ten chapters. Old time revivals
are described and incidents
related which are calculated to thrill
the reader and beget a longing desire
for the return of the Old Time Revival
Power."</p>

<p><b>Bishop N. Castle:</b> "It surely has the
old time swing. It is rich in sentiment,
thrilling, heart-inspiring. It
certainly will have a large sale."</p>

<p><b>The Free Methodist:</b> "An excellent
compilation of facts in connection with
old time revivals and contains much
solid truth respecting old time repentance,
conversion, and righteousness.
The author quotes from 'Fletcher's
Appeal,' Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress,'
James B. Finley, James Caughey,
and other noted 'old time' writers and
evangelists. The work is full of interest
and can but do good. We bespeak
for it a large sale."</p>

<p><b>Religious Telescope:</b> "'The Old-Time
Religion,' by S. B. SHAW, is a
new book, which is a revelation of
the awful corruption of sin and of the
mighty transforming power of the
grace of God. Other books by the same
author have had a sale of nearly a
HALF MILLION copies, and we consider
this book fully equal, if not superior,
to any of them."</p></blockquote>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
